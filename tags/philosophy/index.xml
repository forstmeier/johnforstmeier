      <title>Orthodoxy Rising</title>

      <description>This post reflects a general personal sense - I&amp;rsquo;ve looked for no data to back up the position. It&amp;rsquo;s purely an observation and prediction based on gut. That statement is:
 The current political and social climate is turning my generation towards tradition.
 Being inundated with polarization while simultaneously being drawn into diametrically opposed systems of hyper-individualism and hyper-collectivism has been socially destructive. Individualism destroys meaning while collectivism destroys agency.</description>

      <title>Reading: Religion and Rocketry</title>

      <description>The short essay &amp;ldquo;Religion and Rocketry&amp;rdquo; from C.S. Lewis&amp;rsquo; [1] collection The World&amp;rsquo;s Last Night [2] addresses the existence of extraterrestrial life.
What&amp;rsquo;s interesting about this piece is that it takes their existence for granted and digs into the theological and ethical implications their existence entails. Lewis poses a series of questions regarding their spiritual nature - two in particular ask whether the aliens are fallen, as we are, and what, if any, mechanism exists for their redemption.</description>

      <description>Radically hold rational positions
 Being open to new ideas does not mean you need to immediately accept everything that comes your way. Challenge them, push them, fight them.
Let the best ideas win.</description>

      <title>Reading: Orthodoxy</title>

      <description>Here are a series of short notes on G.K. Chesterton&amp;rsquo;s [1] book Orthodoxy [2].
Chesterton earns the nickname the &amp;ldquo;prince of paradox&amp;rdquo;; every chapter contains multiple statements that flip the conventional perspective. Two statements in particular from the chapter &amp;ldquo;The Flag of the World&amp;rdquo; stood out.
 Rational optimism leads to stagnation; it is irrational optimism that leads to reform.
  The more transcendental is your patriotism, the more practical are your politics.</description>

      <title>Reading: Cynical Theories</title>
      <link>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/reading-cynical-theories/</link>

      <description>This is a brief summary of takeaways from reading Cynical Theories [1] by James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose of &amp;ldquo;grievance studies affair&amp;rdquo; [2] infamy.
Overall, the book does an excellent job outlining the history of the overarching worldview termed &amp;ldquo;critical theory&amp;rdquo; as well as presenting a number of succinct counter arguments against it.
The most interesting topics covered are the breakdowns of the individual fields within the broader philosophy.
Tracing specific ancestries and outlining each field&amp;rsquo;s current form and emphasis within the umbrella is highly valuable; it highlights both specific facets that the laity may more successfully understand and grapple with as well as potentially destructive tensions between the fields making up &amp;ldquo;critical theory.</description>

      <title>Moral Laws</title>

      <description>Laws can and should be based on immutable, moral principles, but that does not mean we need to codify and enforce every one of our morals on other people.
Sins should be easier to commit than laws should be to break.</description>

      <description>There is a difference between happiness and joy.
Happiness is the emotion. Joy is the spirit.</description>

      <title>Philosophic Ancestry</title>

      <description>While I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with most philosophic and religious traditions, I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine a world that is better where Great Meteoron, Potala Palace, Shaolin Temple, Simonopetra, Blagaj Tekke, Sera Monastery, Tungnath, and many others, are silent. I really believe these monuments, and the faiths that they symbolize, to be important to our shared social fabric and our connection to our past.
The beauty and diversity of antique philosophy should be fought for and maintained.</description>

      <title>Natural Variables</title>
      <link>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/natural-variables/</link>

      <description>Variables utilized in human decision making should be based in the natural world rather than arbitrary selection.
An example of this is consent. In order for consent to be actually given, the individual has to be fully cognizant of the situation and not coerced. Being cognizant would, theoretically, require a fully developed brain - although this canâ€™t be accurately assessed on-demand and on a case-by-case basis, the age for consent (alcohol, military service, driving, sex, etc.</description>

      <title>Increased Self-Direction</title>
      <link>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/increased-self-direction/</link>

      <description>The goal of increased individual self-direction requires providing both the individual decision-making capacity and the resources to take action with.
This is a personal goal of mine to provide both of these factors for both myself in my own life and for others in theirs. Individuals should be maximally free to self-direct and be able to utilize as many resources as possible, in many cases, to engage in productive endeavors.</description>

      <description>The greatest truths are simple. Probably one of the most important things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from C.S. Lewis.</description>
