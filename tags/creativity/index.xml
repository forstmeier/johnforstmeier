      <title>Reading: Chaos Monkeys</title>

      <description>This is a brief summary of my takeaways from Chaos Monkeys [1] by Antonio Garcia Martinez [2].
It&amp;rsquo;s a phenomenal education without the textbook.
In particular, the way Martinez recounts navigating the interpersonal relationships in his professional endeavours is highly valuable. It is something that can only be taught directly (your own experience) or recounted (his own experience) - doing so in a classroom would be absurd and stilted.
Each pivotal moment felt like Martinez was managing individual incentives for the involved parties and netting them against each other in order to optimize each outcome.</description>

      <title>FAFO Method</title>
      <link>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/fafo-method/</link>

      <description>An approach I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about is something I&amp;rsquo;m dubbing the &amp;ldquo;FAFO Method&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fuck around, find out&amp;rdquo;.
Basically, this boils down to:
 Learn the minimum about an idea to be dangerous Quickly iterate and implement the idea  It&amp;rsquo;s not quite a &amp;ldquo;see what sticks&amp;rdquo; method because you still want to evaluate and prioritize how you spend your time prior to spending it. And then on top of that, you want to minimize the time actually spent doing the thing.</description>

      <title>Make Tools</title>

      <description>If you can&amp;rsquo;t do a thing, make tools for those who can.
 If you find yourself in a creative slump, look around and see what other people are working on. Build them something that would make them even more productive.</description>

      <title>Indirect Participation</title>

      <description>If you can&amp;rsquo;t do a thing, build tools for those who can.
 By this I mean that if you&amp;rsquo;re struggling to find inspiration or are interested in a field without an immediate affinity or ability you can still be productive.
You can participate indirectly by building tools for others in that field in order to help them scale their impact.</description>

      <title>Boring Problems</title>
      <link>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/boring-problems/</link>

      <description>Boring problems often have fascinating solutions.
 This may be more or less true, and is likely dependent on personal experience, but I’ve found that boring problems have typically been left un-explored for the very reason that they’re boring. This makes it all new territory for someone venturing into it. Whatever they make to solve the problem will be entirely new.</description>

      <title>Minimal Resource Creativity</title>
      <link>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/minimal-resource-creativity/</link>

      <description>It really seems like a minimal resource set necessitates creative solutions and efficient design.
I’m a firm believer in this. It’s sort of like building with a limited number of LEGOs: it forces you to think creatively and with imagination while also knowing intimately the number of pieces you have left and how they can work together.
 Necessity is the mother of invention.

      <title>Simple Solution Fun</title>

      <description>Building simple solutions is fun.
This falls in with my overall philosophy of minimalism. Build lots of simple solutions and then weave them together to form something big.</description>

      <title>Challenging Innovations</title>
      <link>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/challenging-innovations/</link>

      <description>Many innovations today focus on making life easier - why not build things that make life more challenging?
This sounds silly but I like the idea of building things that push us forward and challenge us physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, philosophically. Things like hard science and deep tech are going to really push us more than service-based innovation.</description>

      <title>Unscripted Interactions</title>

      <description>Unscripted interactions are the truest demonstration of a subject matter knowledge and interest.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always preferred unscripted and unprompted discussions. I think the reason for this is because I think it shows a more genuine side of the subject.
For example, I prefer the live/unscripted entertainment bits provided by Rooster Teeth and Funhaus over the more choreographed pieces. Similarly, I think I received more thoughtful and groundbreaking insight from C.S. Lewis&amp;rsquo;s notes and letter than I have from most of his &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; works.</description>
