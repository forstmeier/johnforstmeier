      <description>This is a brief summary of The Coddling of the American Mind [1] by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt.
In short, it is a well developed, explained, and supported book that is heavily data-driven. Overall, the book is critical of the &amp;ldquo;safetyism&amp;rdquo; which is increasingly present in society and encourages building more resillient members of the broader community.
The authors highlight specific issues in how the younger generations (at the time of its writing) are being raised and present targeted solutions that parents may act upon.</description>

      <description>A progressive approach to education is to experiment with new methods intead of focusing solely on expanding access to old methods.
These older methods, particularly the four year college in the U.S., are increasingly misaligned with student goals and fail to deliver successful outcomes. [1]
Pumping money into failing approaches is not progressive.</description>

      <title>Student Value Extraction</title>

      <description>As of the time of this writing, the average dropout rate for U.S. college freshmen is approximately 30%. Traditional four-year schools appear to be un/intentionally positioning for this to maximize value extraction from attending students.
Anecdotal observations point to freshman and sophomore classes having significantly higher student-teacher ratios than junior and senior classes, on average.
Several education spaces at the Penn State University Park campus have massive seating capacity and are often used by lower-year classes.</description>

      <description>Currently, there is a conflation between higher education and vocational training. Typical, four-year degrees are providing both a general education and serving as credentialing frequently required in the workforce. Separating these aspects could provide more tailored services to students based on interest and need.
