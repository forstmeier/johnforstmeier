      <description>Some characteristics of pharmaceuticals make them comparable to software. Basically software and pharmaceuticals have:
 high development costs low distribution costs  For example, both require a large, upfront resource investment in research and composition. After initial R&amp;amp;D expenses, both are relatively easily manufactured and distributed at scale.
Knowing this, pharmaceuticals may be well placed to leverage wide-reaching treatments while reducing healthcare costs. Additionally, with precision medicine [1], highly-focused solutions can be developed or even compounded on-demand for individual use to increase effectiveness.</description>
