      <title>Evolving Primate Ethics</title>

      <description>If we assume that non-human primates are experiencing evolutionary growth we may eventually face similar questions to those Lewis raises in Religion and Rocketry [1].
 For example, can the primates have evolved to the point they have received the divine spark of an immortal soul endowed with reason? If so, are they fallen, pre-fallen, post-fallen, or some other state we are not aware of? And what is our responsibility towards our newly-elevated evolutionary cousins?</description>

      <title>Orthodoxy Rising</title>

      <description>This post reflects a general personal sense - I&amp;rsquo;ve looked for no data to back up the position. It&amp;rsquo;s purely an observation and prediction based on gut. That statement is:
 The current political and social climate is turning my generation towards tradition.
 Being inundated with polarization while simultaneously being drawn into diametrically opposed systems of hyper-individualism and hyper-collectivism has been socially destructive. Individualism destroys meaning while collectivism destroys agency.</description>

      <description>The short essay &amp;ldquo;Religion and Rocketry&amp;rdquo; from C.S. Lewis&amp;rsquo; [1] collection The World&amp;rsquo;s Last Night [2] addresses the existence of extraterrestrial life.
What&amp;rsquo;s interesting about this piece is that it takes their existence for granted and digs into the theological and ethical implications their existence entails. Lewis poses a series of questions regarding their spiritual nature - two in particular ask whether the aliens are fallen, as we are, and what, if any, mechanism exists for their redemption.</description>

      <description>Here are a series of short notes on G.K. Chesterton&amp;rsquo;s [1] book Orthodoxy [2].
Chesterton earns the nickname the &amp;ldquo;prince of paradox&amp;rdquo;; every chapter contains multiple statements that flip the conventional perspective. Two statements in particular from the chapter &amp;ldquo;The Flag of the World&amp;rdquo; stood out.
 Rational optimism leads to stagnation; it is irrational optimism that leads to reform.
  The more transcendental is your patriotism, the more practical are your politics.</description>

      <description>The greatest truths are simple. Probably one of the most important things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned from C.S. Lewis.</description>
