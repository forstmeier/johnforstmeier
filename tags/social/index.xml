      <title>Reputation Over Regulation</title>

      <description>Regulations on business interactions between entities can be arbitrary and typically come from a highly centralized source. Market participants must either lobby for changes (which ends up being dominated by larger financial players) or submit to regulation (which all ultimately have to anyway).
Finding ways to prioritize reputation markets, wherever feasible, may be a better alternative. Members of the given market would build a reputation through participation and staking value to have &amp;ldquo;skin in the game&amp;rdquo; and increase the cost to potential manipulators [1].</description>

      <description>Interplanetary colonization will likely lead to the development of new species under the homo genus.
Interstellar colonization absolutely will.
 It&amp;rsquo;s something we should begin planning for.

      <description>The main difference between capitalism and socialism is which end of the machine the human is on. For the former it’s at the levers while for the latter it’s at the tooltip.
 In one the human controls the cogs and in the other the human is a cog

      <title>Reading: The Coddling of the American Mind</title>

      <guid>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/reading-the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/</guid>
      <description>This is a brief summary of The Coddling of the American Mind [1] by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt.
In short, it is a well developed, explained, and supported book that is heavily data-driven. Overall, the book is critical of the &amp;ldquo;safetyism&amp;rdquo; which is increasingly present in society and encourages building more resillient members of the broader community.
The authors highlight specific issues in how the younger generations (at the time of its writing) are being raised and present targeted solutions that parents may act upon.</description>

      <description>This post reflects a general personal sense - I&amp;rsquo;ve looked for no data to back up the position. It&amp;rsquo;s purely an observation and prediction based on gut. That statement is:
 The current political and social climate is turning my generation towards tradition.
 Being inundated with polarization while simultaneously being drawn into diametrically opposed systems of hyper-individualism and hyper-collectivism has been socially destructive. Individualism destroys meaning while collectivism destroys agency.</description>

      <guid>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/progressive-vs-expansive/</guid>
      <description>The term &amp;ldquo;progressive&amp;rdquo; has been conflated with the word &amp;ldquo;expansive&amp;rdquo; with regards to legislative initiatives. In some ways, this is similar to the theme in Peter Thiel&amp;rsquo;s [1] book Zero to One [2].
 moving 0 -&amp;gt; 1 creates an entirely new solution moving 1 -&amp;gt; N scales an existing solution  The latter is dominant while being billed as the former in legislation. Currently, this is particularly true in two areas: minimum wage and college education.</description>

      <description>The short essay &amp;ldquo;Religion and Rocketry&amp;rdquo; from C.S. Lewis&amp;rsquo; [1] collection The World&amp;rsquo;s Last Night [2] addresses the existence of extraterrestrial life.
What&amp;rsquo;s interesting about this piece is that it takes their existence for granted and digs into the theological and ethical implications their existence entails. Lewis poses a series of questions regarding their spiritual nature - two in particular ask whether the aliens are fallen, as we are, and what, if any, mechanism exists for their redemption.</description>

      <description>Anecdotally to the observer, it seems that national adversity produces heroes while personal adversity produces victims.
 Why is there a perceived difference and why can&amp;rsquo;t personal adversity produce public heroes?
 In national-level issues, everyone is impacted and all shoulder the burden while a few rise as leaders. For example, in World War II individuals such as Churchill [1], Murphy [2], Winters [2], and Sendler [4] are rightfully treated as heroes for their noble defense of freedom even as the conflict touched all lives.</description>

      <description>There is an interesting series of questions that can be raised regarding social media listed below.
 Has the net impact of social media been positive or negative in developed nations? Has the net impact of social media been positive or negative in underdeveloped nations? If there is a difference in the answers to those questions, what causes the disparity?  These services have contributed positively and negatively to the world - identifying what distribution these contributions take would be valuable in helping to understand their proper function.</description>

      <description>A progressive approach to education is to experiment with new methods intead of focusing solely on expanding access to old methods.
These older methods, particularly the four year college in the U.S., are increasingly misaligned with student goals and fail to deliver successful outcomes. [1]
Pumping money into failing approaches is not progressive.</description>

      <guid>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/reading-utah-economic-exceptionalism/</guid>
      <description>Several aspects of the Beehive State&amp;rsquo;s socio-economic approach are discussed in an article titled &amp;ldquo;Utah’s Economic Exceptionalism&amp;rdquo; [1] by Natalie Gochnour.
While the state&amp;rsquo;s economic position was solid during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, both in terms of mitigating negative fallout and general rising economic performance, the basis for this success appears to have been in place well prior to the outbreak.
The article points to factors like low income disparity, high upward mobility, and even highly unusual feats such as under budget and early completion in major public works projects as indicators of the state&amp;rsquo;s favorable economic strategy.</description>

      <guid>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/social-capital-preference/</guid>
      <description>Some companies rely heavily on social capital as part of their continued financial success. To varying degrees, this makes them dependent on current social trends.
However, even companies that are not overly impacted by social perception (e.g. ones with strong customer stickiness) seem to seek it out. In doing so they appear to voluntarily relinquish an advantageous position.
 Why take on an unnecessary dependency?
 Maybe there is or always has been a strong need to &amp;ldquo;belong&amp;rdquo; even in profit-driven enterprises.</description>

      <description>Increased local political autonomy may reduce voting majorities to their smallest sphere of influence. This would lead to many, independent, and encapsulated majorities operating within a larger, shared population.
Several interesting points arise in this situation:
 Any tyrannical majority is confined to a small operating area In worst cases even tyrannical majorities are likely generally aligned with local interests Constituents may easily move from tyrannical majorities to elsewhere within the larger population  </description>

      <guid>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/student-value-extraction/</guid>
      <description>As of the time of this writing, the average dropout rate for U.S. college freshmen is approximately 30%. Traditional four-year schools appear to be un/intentionally positioning for this to maximize value extraction from attending students.
Anecdotal observations point to freshman and sophomore classes having significantly higher student-teacher ratios than junior and senior classes, on average.
Several education spaces at the Penn State University Park campus have massive seating capacity and are often used by lower-year classes.</description>

      <description>This is a breakdown of the encyclical Fratelli Tutti [1] written by Pope Francis.
The encyclical covers a wide range of topics and displays a generally more political tone while attempting to balance diverging viewpoints. Sometimes this leads to over-simplification or self-contradiction.
This note primarily discusses socio-economic subjects and reference numbers are provided for the appropriate sections of the encyclical.

      <description>Sometimes prior stages of human development are presented as a model to emulate with claims the early homo genuses better coexisted with their natural environment.
Contrary evidence [1] indicates early humans directly contributed to megafaunal extinction events across the globe; the correlative findings show mass extinctions were immediately preceeded by the arrival of migrating humans. Other factors may have contributed but these were not as significant as the presence of human hunters.</description>

      <description>This is a brief summary of takeaways from reading Cynical Theories [1] by James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose of &amp;ldquo;grievance studies affair&amp;rdquo; [2] infamy.
Overall, the book does an excellent job outlining the history of the overarching worldview termed &amp;ldquo;critical theory&amp;rdquo; as well as presenting a number of succinct counter arguments against it.
The most interesting topics covered are the breakdowns of the individual fields within the broader philosophy.
Tracing specific ancestries and outlining each field&amp;rsquo;s current form and emphasis within the umbrella is highly valuable; it highlights both specific facets that the laity may more successfully understand and grapple with as well as potentially destructive tensions between the fields making up &amp;ldquo;critical theory.</description>

      <description>An alternative news consumption paradigm could be one where individuals build themselves ad-hoc collections to establish a &amp;ldquo;microservice architecture&amp;rdquo; of preferred sources. Ideally, these sources would be smaller groups or independent journalists potentially providing highly specialized coverage and reporting - some sources might even exist only as long as the story they cover. All news producers would be treated as modular and replaceable.
This fragmentation would force consumers to actively build their own networks while also reducing narrative centralization from large producers.</description>

      <title>Citizen&#39;s Dividend Competition</title>

      <guid>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/citizens-dividend-competition/</guid>
      <description>A non-guaranteed citizen&amp;rsquo;s dividend introduces fiscal competition between political parties that are members of the dividend issuing government.
For common equity dividends the amount per share is determined by profit surplus roughly calculated as revenue minus cost. Similarly, a citizen&amp;rsquo;s dividend is determined by government revenue minus government cost. Given government revenue is often primarily driven by taxation, the least impactful way to increase distributions to constituents is to reduce government costs.</description>

      <description>The land value tax (&amp;ldquo;LVT&amp;rdquo;) at the center of Georgism directly encourages efficient land usage in energy production. Given that this core principal assesses taxes as a percentage of the value of the land held, it drives producers to establish the smallest physical footprint possible.
If it were introduced, there would be an immediate impact to all existing energy producers:
 &amp;ldquo;Traditional&amp;rdquo; fuels (e.g. oil, LNG, coal): large land, and potentially offshore, resources would be adjusted to find the optimal boundary of exerting exclusive rights to the resources and minimizing the taxable land held; additionally the valuable resources held in the land would increase the land value and taxes owed.</description>

      <description>Being a healthy skeptic of authority is a good thing. The keyword being healthy.
A certain amount of structure is definitely necessary to enable human socio-economic interactions. But evaluations of the structure should be constantly made:
 Evaluate the validity of the those in authority - does their position of power stem from the governed? Evaluate whether their actions fall within the purview of those in authority - are they doing what they have the capacity to do on behalf of the governed?</description>

I really believe these monuments, and the faiths that they symbolize, to be important to our shared social fabric and our connection to our past.

      <description>Something that strikes me:
 Small opportunities to be good seem so difficult to take advantage of while the truly great require no deliberation.
 I wonder if this has to do with smaller opportunities so often coming into conflict with prevailing social norms while the options that accompany truly great opportunities are universally held to be true. Now this isn&amp;rsquo;t to say the small are lesser but that accomplishing them requires a different kind of courage.</description>

      <description>Large numbers of small producers reduces market consolidation and increases economic resiliency. Sort of an microservice economy.
While there&amp;rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with large producers, who often provide beneficial economies of scale, smaller operations may more easily avoid turning employees into &amp;ldquo;cogs.&amp;rdquo; Also, with smaller operations, there&amp;rsquo;s less possibility of drastic market centralization and consolidation of risk. No one entity dictates the activities of the market.</description>

      <guid>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/distributism-maker-ownership/</guid>
      <description>The theory of distributism [1] encourages maker ownership of the means and output of production while maintaining a free market. Together, this makes for a system designed around individual self-direction and establishes human dignity at the center of the philosophy.
A move towards distributism is a move towards a true system of social justice.</description>

      <description>Maximizing productive output while maintaining individual rights and dignity is the primary concern in an increasingly automated workforce system. Open source caters to this scenario and provides hyper-productive individuals with a series of resources to leverage their output and effectively provide for consumers.

      <description>The state is a monopoly on legislation; democracy is out best way of introducing competition.
I generally stand against any kind of monopoly and I think, in some respects, the state can be described in this way. Now, I don&amp;rsquo;t want it abolished, but I do want it challenged.</description>

      <description>Open source software projects are a collaborative effort. Individual developers contribute to the betterment of the project and create a publicly available, shared resource.
This model opts to create, rather than directly capture, value. Additionally, competitive markets are maintained around the project since individuals are free to take it and build products or services using it.
Since all parties share core intellectual property, competition is encouraged around the &amp;ldquo;edges&amp;rdquo; and where comparative advantages apply with some participants opting to keep these facets closed source.</description>
