      <description>Startups can generally finance via bootstrapping or venture capital backing or some combination of the two (ignoring straight debt financing as it&amp;rsquo;s atypical in this scenario).
Going forward, pure software and SaaS companies are likely to start to focus on the former while hard-tech startups with a physical component will likely dominate the later.
The former has increasingly lower barriers for entry (hosting, tooling, etc.) - this means it&amp;rsquo;s a more highly competitive field with lower expected upside potential for each startup.</description>

      <description>High-frequency trading (&amp;ldquo;HFT&amp;rdquo;) [1] is often portrayed negatively and as &amp;ldquo;taking advantage&amp;rdquo; of retail investors through blindingly fast trading strategies.
In reality, HFT firms are just 1) employing research and technology effectively and 2) taking on high amounts of investment risk. Essentially, they are shouldering the very high upfront cost of these tools which are an absolute prerequisite to even trying to reap the rewards of this strategy.
Instead of taking a stance against HFT, participation in these funds should be made directly available to more retail investors so long as they&amp;rsquo;re aware of the risk.</description>
