      <title>Retail HFT</title>

      <description>High-frequency trading (&amp;ldquo;HFT&amp;rdquo;) [1] is often portrayed negatively and as &amp;ldquo;taking advantage&amp;rdquo; of retail investors through blindingly fast trading strategies.
In reality, HFT firms are just 1) employing research and technology effectively and 2) taking on high amounts of investment risk. Essentially, they are shouldering the very high upfront cost of these tools which are an absolute prerequisite to even trying to reap the rewards of this strategy.
Instead of taking a stance against HFT, participation in these funds should be made directly available to more retail investors so long as they&amp;rsquo;re aware of the risk.</description>

      <description>The main difference between capitalism and socialism is which end of the machine the human is on. For the former it’s at the levers while for the latter it’s at the tooltip.
 In one the human controls the cogs and in the other the human is a cog

      <description>Financial markets should be easy to enter but difficult to actively participate in.
 Encouraging reduced barriers to entry and limitations on participation improve price discovery through the removal of arbitrary restrictions. However, a big caveat should be made to retail investors so that they&amp;rsquo;re aware that they&amp;rsquo;re very likely outgunned by the resources available to institutional investors.
Markets should be much closer to an &amp;ldquo;anything goes&amp;rdquo; model while making transaction and holdings data public.</description>

      <title>Progressive vs Expansive</title>
      <link>https://forstmeier.github.io/notes/progressive-vs-expansive/</link>

      <guid>https://forstmeier.github.io/notes/progressive-vs-expansive/</guid>
      <description>The term &amp;ldquo;progressive&amp;rdquo; has been conflated with the word &amp;ldquo;expansive&amp;rdquo; with regards to legislative initiatives. In some ways, this is similar to the theme in Peter Thiel&amp;rsquo;s [1] book Zero to One [2].
 moving 0 -&amp;gt; 1 creates an entirely new solution moving 1 -&amp;gt; N scales an existing solution  The latter is dominant while being billed as the former in legislation. Currently, this is particularly true in two areas: minimum wage and college education.</description>

      <title>Reading: Utah’s Economic Exceptionalism</title>
      <link>https://forstmeier.github.io/notes/reading-utah-economic-exceptionalism/</link>

      <guid>https://forstmeier.github.io/notes/reading-utah-economic-exceptionalism/</guid>
      <description>Several aspects of the Beehive State&amp;rsquo;s socio-economic approach are discussed in an article titled &amp;ldquo;Utah’s Economic Exceptionalism&amp;rdquo; [1] by Natalie Gochnour.
While the state&amp;rsquo;s economic position was solid during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, both in terms of mitigating negative fallout and general rising economic performance, the basis for this success appears to have been in place well prior to the outbreak.
The article points to factors like low income disparity, high upward mobility, and even highly unusual feats such as under budget and early completion in major public works projects as indicators of the state&amp;rsquo;s favorable economic strategy.</description>

      <description>This is a breakdown of the encyclical Fratelli Tutti [1] written by Pope Francis.
The encyclical covers a wide range of topics and displays a generally more political tone while attempting to balance diverging viewpoints. Sometimes this leads to over-simplification or self-contradiction.
This note primarily discusses socio-economic subjects and reference numbers are provided for the appropriate sections of the encyclical.
   Topic Summary Comments     Culture Exporting or copying cultural models reduces national identity (#51) and different cultures are not enemies (#147).</description>

      <title>Citizen&#39;s Dividend Competition</title>
      <link>https://forstmeier.github.io/notes/citizens-dividend-competition/</link>

      <description>A non-guaranteed citizen&amp;rsquo;s dividend introduces fiscal competition between political parties that are members of the dividend issuing government.
For common equity dividends the amount per share is determined by profit surplus roughly calculated as revenue minus cost. Similarly, a citizen&amp;rsquo;s dividend is determined by government revenue minus government cost. Given government revenue is often primarily driven by taxation, the least impactful way to increase distributions to constituents is to reduce government costs.</description>

      <description>The difference in the concepts of a citizen&amp;rsquo;s dividend and universal basic income (&amp;ldquo;UBI&amp;rdquo;) are laid out in the terms &amp;ldquo;dividend&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;income.&amp;rdquo;
   Feature Dividend Income     Amount Floating value based on excess revenue Fixed value determined by contract   Frequency Non-guaranteed, likely monthly/quarterly Guaranteed, determined by contract   Source Equity ownership allocates share Labor contributed under contract    These features are present in fiscal policy options.</description>

      <title>Georgism and Energy</title>
      <link>https://forstmeier.github.io/notes/georgism-and-energy/</link>

      <description>The land value tax (&amp;ldquo;LVT&amp;rdquo;) at the center of Georgism directly encourages efficient land usage in energy production. Given that this core principal assesses taxes as a percentage of the value of the land held, it drives producers to establish the smallest physical footprint possible.
If it were introduced, there would be an immediate impact to all existing energy producers:
 &amp;ldquo;Traditional&amp;rdquo; fuels (e.g. oil, LNG, coal): large land, and potentially offshore, resources would be adjusted to find the optimal boundary of exerting exclusive rights to the resources and minimizing the taxable land held; additionally the valuable resources held in the land would increase the land value and taxes owed.</description>

      <title>Economic Mesas</title>
      <link>https://forstmeier.github.io/notes/economic-mesas/</link>

      <guid>https://forstmeier.github.io/notes/economic-mesas/</guid>
      <description>A citizen&amp;rsquo;s dividend would create an &amp;ldquo;economic mesa&amp;rdquo; and establish a natural and humane border.
Following the Georgist [1] model, a citizen&amp;rsquo;s dividend would have the side effect of providing an additional method for defining and enforcing sovereign territory. Legal citizens would receive the non-guaranteed dividend, pro rata, which would generally shift prices higher in the region they spend it - predominantly where they live. A resource disparity would arise between the citizens and the citizens of neighboring countries.</description>

      <title>Reverse Equity</title>

      <description>Something to consider:
 Equity creates equity in the employees from the point of view of the company.
  Equity: relatively non-liquid asset conveying financial value from dividends and non-financial value from voting rights Salary: highly liquid asset conveying financial value on receipt and provides no non-financial value  The former establishes a direct and more-or-less permanent investment in the company by the employee while the latter is available to the employee only through the life of the employment contract.</description>

      <description>Companies that unite shareholders and stakeholders invest in their employees and community. And this happens at the same time.
Introducing perpetually issued and held &amp;ldquo;sweat equity&amp;rdquo; for employees helps to build bonds with employees and alleviate reliance on the &amp;ldquo;salary drug.&amp;rdquo; Bringing these two together lets individuals keep what they build. [1]</description>

      <description>Large numbers of small producers reduces market consolidation and increases economic resiliency. Sort of an microserivce economy.
While there&amp;rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with large producers, who often provide beneficial economies of scale, smaller operations may more easily avoid turning employees into &amp;ldquo;cogs.&amp;rdquo; Also, with smaller operations, there&amp;rsquo;s less possibility of drastic market centralization and consolidation of risk. No one entity dictates the activities of the market.</description>

      <description>An important aspect of craftsmanship is earning the pride you take in your work.
The &amp;ldquo;niche&amp;rdquo; production approach where output is owned by the individuals who produce it, as encouraged by distributism, encourages thoughtful satisfaction in one&amp;rsquo;s accomplishment.</description>

      <title>Distributism Maker Ownership</title>
      <link>https://forstmeier.github.io/notes/distributism-maker-ownership/</link>

      <guid>https://forstmeier.github.io/notes/distributism-maker-ownership/</guid>
      <description>The theory of distributism [1] encourages maker ownership of the means and output of production while maintaining a free market. Together, this makes for a system designed around individual self-direction and establishes human dignity at the center of the philosophy.
A move towards distributism is a move towards a true system of social justice.</description>

      <description>Maximizing productive output while maintaining individual rights and dignity is the primary concern in an increasingly automated workforce system. Open source caters to this scenario and provides hyper-productive individuals with a series of resources to leverage their output and effectively provide for consumers.
Benefits
 Common knowledge pool: shared and open intellectual property which reduces &amp;ldquo;reinvention&amp;rdquo; by participants creating proprietary alternatives Non-overlapping markets: entities focus on &amp;ldquo;peripheral&amp;rdquo; markets surrounding shared core resources which encourages focus on competitive advantages Lower entry barriers: new participants can enter market rapidly as core intellectual property is openly available for use Value creation prioritization: more value is created from open resources than is captured by each individual producer Balances market forces: monopolization and perfect competition are avoided through public core resources and competitive advantage focuses Supply chain cooperation: &amp;ldquo;niche&amp;rdquo; edge producers collaborating between individual horizontal and vertical segments Adaptive technologies: common core resources with multiple contributors provides rapid updates for changing environments/requirements  Consumers benefit in this scenario of a hyper-productive minority operating in a highly automated workforce through more rapid innovation and product development.</description>

      <title>Open Source Economic Good</title>

      <guid>https://forstmeier.github.io/notes/open-source-economic-good/</guid>
      <description>Open source software projects are a collaborative effort. Individual developers contribute to the betterment of the project and create a publicly available, shared resource.
This model opts to create, rather than directly capture, value. Additionally, competitive markets are maintained around the project since individuals are free to take it and build products or services using it.
Since all parties share core intellectual property, competition is encouraged around the &amp;ldquo;edges&amp;rdquo; and where comparative advantages apply with some participants opting to keep these facets closed source.</description>
