      <description>This piece is on Bad Blood [1] by John Carreyrou [2].
I was familiar with the story of Elizabeth Holmes [3] and her company Theranos [4] but the book provided greater insight into how she interacted with people regarding her work.
It is unclear whether her extreme focus on &amp;ldquo;her mission&amp;rdquo; was a manipulative effort or actual self-denial; her actions could support both positions.
There are many instances of Holmes legally pursuing whistleblowers and publicly attacking external detractors - essentially anyone threatening the positive perception of Theranos.</description>

      <title>Pharmaceuticals As Software</title>

      <description>Some characteristics of pharmaceuticals make them comparable to software. Basically software and pharmaceuticals have:
 high development costs low distribution costs  For example, both require a large, upfront resource investment in research and composition. After initial R&amp;amp;D expenses, both are relatively easily manufactured and distributed at scale.
Knowing this, pharmaceuticals may be well placed to leverage wide-reaching treatments while reducing healthcare costs. Additionally, with precision medicine [1], highly-focused solutions can be developed or even compounded on-demand for individual use to increase effectiveness.</description>
