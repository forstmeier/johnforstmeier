I seek a future of **_extreme ownership_**. Individuals owning increasingly greater elements so each may personally steward the world around them.

> Spaceships, space stations, planets, solar systems, galaxies.

Each person _individually_ protecting greater tracts of creation. While some may still be drawn to the noble pursuit of asceticism, many must shoulder the mantle of the universe.
