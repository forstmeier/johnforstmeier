Many, if not most, startups are founded to solve a specific problem. Now I'm increasingly noticing startups founded around **defending specific principles**.

It's really interesting seeing founders standing for a set of principles and then finding a way for the market to support and defend those principles through private enterprise. Examples of these principles are defending U.S. constitutional rights or Western thought and ideals.

Startups built like this are incapable of caving to serve fad ideologies or immoral positions because their entire purpose, and profit incentives, are aligned with their **principles-first approach**.
