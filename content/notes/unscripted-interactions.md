**Unscripted interactions** are the truest demonstration of a subject matter knowledge and interest.

I've always preferred unscripted and unprompted discussions. I think the reason for this is because I think it shows a more genuine side of the subject.

For example, I prefer the live/unscripted entertainment bits provided by Rooster Teeth and Funhaus over the more choreographed pieces. Similarly, I think I received more thoughtful and groundbreaking insight from C.S. Lewis's notes and letter than I have from most of his "official" works.
