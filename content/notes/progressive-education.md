A **progressive** approach to education is to experiment with new methods intead of focusing solely on expanding access to old methods.

These older methods, particularly the four year college in the U.S., are increasingly misaligned with student goals and fail to deliver successful outcomes. [[1](https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/splitting-education-1-0/ "Splitting Education - Forstmeier")]

Pumping money into failing approaches is not **progressive**.
