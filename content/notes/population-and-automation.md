> Population decline is a greater threat to social cohesion than employment automation.

Increased automation typically leads to increased productivity; historically, it has triggered the creation of entirely new industries (e.g. motor vehicles).

Declining populations provide no economic or social benfit - in this scenario, there are few young, productive individuals required to support many old, dependent individuals.

Not only is automation **_not bad_**, we're going to need **_significantly more_** of it in the future especially in the face of population decline.
