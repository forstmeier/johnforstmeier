- thought experiment
- thinking alternative terrorist attack vectors
- terorism: violence against non-combatants achieve ideological ends
    - include wikipedia link
- anecdotally observed hallmarks
- 1: improvised weaponry
- 2: outsided leverage (attacked / attacker ratio)
- thinking less large-scale targets
- involve more planning
- potentially more easily uncovered + stopped
- but lone-wolf attacks notable impact
- create "distributed" attack
- basically using social graphs
- targeting most connected
- loss felt by most people
- "lone-wolf" w/ single victims across distrubted attack surface
- requires significant human investment
- also likely still uncoverable
- scenario worth evaluating
