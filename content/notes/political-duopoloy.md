Established political duopolies hold their members on platforms that can devolve into what can be summarized as "anti-opposing party." Time is spent condemning the opposition's stances without defending, or sometimes even _presenting_, alternatives. While there may be philosophic stratification within the dual parties, these differences are subordinate to the party positions.

Splitting these duopolies into **multiple mini-parties** encourages more active discourse and requires proactive engagement among colleagues when presenting and defending positions.

> Flexible, ad hoc coalition formation would be the result.

This would switch the structure from implicit alignment within a larger party to explicit alliance between smaller parties. Ideally, this would also result in a better representation of constituent demographics and preferences.
