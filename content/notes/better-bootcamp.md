Coding bootcamps seem to focus heavily on the _coding_ aspect of development work. While teaching coding is important, I think bootcamps could differentiate themselves significantly by focusing on developing team-based skills and experience.

For example they could:

- provide students with guidance on how to receive and conduct pull request reviews
- go over designing and maintaining robust CI/CD pipelines
- instill best-practices for writing unit and integration tests
- participate in tasking stories and organizing development sprints

And this could potentially be done within the scope of a pre-existing open source project.

In this paradigm:

- maintainers would lead the students who would operate as contributors
- code specifics would primarily be offloaded onto students in a self-taught manner
- "gotchas" resources could be provided to help understand language and project specifics

This would provide a _real-world_ and _hands-on_ approach to interacting with a team and a codebase rather than in a classroom-style setting. Effectively they would be "learning on the job" while the project benefits from open source contributions.
