Here are some more loose ideas on simple ways to potentially improve the U.S. political system.

**Ideas**

1. **Quantifiable legislative goals**: during campaigns, politicians should pledge, or maybe even be required, to set out a handful of specific policy goals with quantifiable outcomes (and preset measurement criteria). If these goals were met, assuming a successful election, they could run again after their term expires.

> Goal: move elections towards data-driven performers.

2. **Campaign finance simplification**: only allow personal donations with a maximum donation amount - this could mirror the fact that each citizen only gets one vote and financial disparities should not come into play.

> Goal: reducing financial influence on elections.

3. **Donation-based salaries**: elected officials and their staffs draw their salaries from their donation pools alone without federal funding. Exceptions could potentially be made for providing services like security or official engagement transport.

> Goal: preventing politicians from manipulating their own salaries.

4. **War chest management**: this may already exist but political candidates could set a predefined distribution strategy for their accummulated donations in the event of a campaign loss (e.g. naming a charitable organization in their consituency as a beneficiary if the campaign fails and disclose this to donors).

> Goal: improving visibility into donation usage.
