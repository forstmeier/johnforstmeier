Something that I have to keep reminding myself is that products aren't just products, they're a **value delivery system**. Products will only be adopted when value is received by using them. This means that the initial build of the product should contain the absolute minimum resources required to begin delivering that value.

Improvements can be rolled out in later iterations, even significant breaking changes [[1](https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/initial-backwards-compatibility/ "Initial Backwards Compatibility - Forstmeier")], so long as **_value delivery_** can be immediately proven.
