A personal weakness is evaluating individuals during interviews both as an interviewee and interviewer. To combat this, I want to establish a series of questions to help identify project and team fit. Ideally, these have some sort of concrete "metric-like" answer. Most will be applicable to either scenario.

**List**

- What percent of your savings would you put into this project?
- What is your minimum viable product for this project?
- What are you currently doing that doesn't scale?
- Which of no bugs, all features, and on time do you pick for this project?
- Would you choose to deploy 70% of value to a user in 1 week or 90% of value in 2 weeks?
