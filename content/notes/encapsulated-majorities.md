Increased local political autonomy may reduce voting majorities to their smallest sphere of influence.  This would lead to many, independent, and encapsulated majorities operating within a larger, shared population.

Several interesting points arise in this situation:

1. Any tyrannical majority is confined to a small operating area
2. In worst cases even tyrannical majorities are likely generally aligned with local interests
3. Constituents may easily move from tyrannical majorities to elsewhere within the larger population
