Large numbers of small producers reduces market consolidation and increases economic resiliency. Sort of an microservice economy.

While there's nothing inherently wrong with large producers, who often provide beneficial economies of scale, smaller operations may more easily avoid turning employees into "cogs." Also, with smaller operations, there's less possibility of drastic market centralization and consolidation of risk. No one entity dictates the activities of the market.
