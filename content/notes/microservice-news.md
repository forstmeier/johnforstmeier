An alternative news consumption paradigm could be one where individuals build themselves ad-hoc collections to establish a "microservice architecture" of preferred sources. Ideally, these sources would be smaller groups or independent journalists potentially providing highly specialized coverage and reporting - some sources might even exist only as long as the story they cover. All news producers would be treated as **modular** and **replaceable**.

This fragmentation would force consumers to _actively build their own networks_ while also reducing narrative centralization from large producers. While it would still be possible for readers to build information echo chambers, to do so would require an active effort and would lack the input of recommendation engines.
