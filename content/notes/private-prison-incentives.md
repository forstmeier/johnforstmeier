Adjusting private prison contracts may better align their incentives with what the public expects from them as a service.

Prison is intended to either _temporarily punish and rehabilitate_ or _permanently remove_ offenders from society.  The more cases that can be shifted to the former, the better.

And to do that, contracts could be based around the post-release actions of the formerly incarcerated. For example, repeat offenses, recidivism, and other lapses would **negatively financially impact** the prison that should be primarily focused on rehabilitation.

This shifts the focus of the system on improving the post-incarceration outcomes of their former inmates - similar to how ISAs have begun changing incentives in education.
