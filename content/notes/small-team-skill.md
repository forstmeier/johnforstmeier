One of the most important skills a _small_ team can collectively have is the ability to identify what they **don't need to build** for a _minimum viable product_ ("MVP").

Smaller teams inherently have fewer human resources available to build things and must prioritize. An open two-way dialogue between the team and the customer helps identify the _core value_ the product provides the customers. With this the team can provide that initial _core value_ in their MVP even if it's held together with rubber bands and bubble gum.
