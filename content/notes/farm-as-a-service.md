- followup prior post
- discussing u.s. farming exceptionalism
- presented several targets improvement
- now focusing specific proposed solutions
- specific points:
    - small acreage farms
        - highly specialized crops
        - need ~$10k to break even (as of 2014)
        - include gmos
        - more resillient/higher yield crops
        - more sustainable/greater nutrition
    - servicify hardware
        - don't own + just rent/hire
        - highly automated
        - account aging farmers/lower workforce
        - applicator: applies pesticides/herbicides/fertilizers
        - harvester: harvests/collects crops
        - hourly operational costs are increasing

    - inter-farm orchestration
        - create larger "synthetic" farm
        - allows farmer ownership
        - distributist approach
        - economies of scale available larger farms
        - boost saf output to >$500k (highest/rarest bracket)
    - digital field twin
        - sub/pub + data api
        - create system farmers update
        - basically maintaining database w/ hardware collection/inputs
        - more data fed into fass == better saf integration/orchestration
        - more data from individual farms == more efficient equipment deployment
        - give data == get better service (from farmer perspective)
        - get data == give better service (from provider perspective)
        - "field-driven actions"
        - telematics: tracking physiclal resources automatically

        - samsara (company) - equipment monitoring solution
            - API: https://developers.samsara.com/reference/overview
    - enclosed + vertical growth
        - more crops/control
        - supported by current data
        - https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/43847/46432_eib123.pdf?v=0
            - poultry, hogs, greenhouses largest shares of saf sales
                - things that can live indoors w/ controlled environments
                - allows intensive growing
                - year-round production
        - potential increase crop growth
            - nasa technics "trick" plants to bloom
                - blue/red LED lights
                - ~6x faster
        - controlled fertilizer applications
            - boost yields
            - w/o runoff/soil damage/nutrient depletion
