Open source software projects are a collaborative effort. Individual developers contribute to the betterment of the project and create a publicly available, shared resource.

This model opts to create, rather than directly capture, value. Additionally, competitive markets are maintained around the project since individuals are free to take it and build products or services using it.

Since all parties share core intellectual property, competition is encouraged around the "edges" and where comparative advantages apply with some participants opting to keep these facets closed source. Dynamic, open economic theaters are created through this paradigm while also preventing monopolies from forming. Changing the default economic mindset to open collaborative competition, as maintained in the open source philosophy, is a significant social benefit and could be applied to all markets.
