The short essay "Religion and Rocketry" from C.S. Lewis' [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis "C.S. Lewis - Wikipedia")] collection _The World's Last Night_ [[2](https://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Last-Night-Other-Essays/dp/0156027712 "The World's Last Night - Amazon")] addresses the existence of extraterrestrial life.

What's interesting about this piece is that it takes their existence for granted and digs into the theological and ethical implications their existence entails. Lewis poses a series of questions regarding their spiritual nature - two in particular ask whether the aliens are **fallen**, as we are, and what, if any, mechanism exists for their **redemption**.

This, to me, is an unexpected and interesting perspective. It's not _what if_ they exist or _why_ they exist - it's much more than that.

> What is the state of their **soul** and what must be done to **protect or redeem** it?

He goes on to discuss these points throughout the essay but it raises a parallel situation. In a similar manner, if we take the eventual creation of general artificial intelligence as a given, and it attains both consciousness and a soul, _what is the construct's state of **grace**_?

- Is it fallen and must be redeemed?
- Can it fall and how should we protect it?

Lewis raises immense questions.
