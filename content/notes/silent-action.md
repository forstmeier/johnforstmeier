> Actions taken to accomplish good works should be done without seeking attention.

Sometimes attention is unavoidable but it should be reduced to the minimal amount needed to get the work done or to what will maximize the impact of the act.

Everything else above this minimized amount is performative and serves no other purpose than self-aggrandizement.
