**Forward momentum** is an important component of actually building things. There are basically two options for keeping that momentum high:

1. Increase the pace of item production
2. Decrease the number of items in production

The latter is most applicable to MVPs ("minimum viable products").

Reducing things to do increases productive turnover and avoids maintaining large mental overhead associated with bigger chunks of work. If it feels like it'll take a long time, the first instinct should be to just say "let's try it without it."
