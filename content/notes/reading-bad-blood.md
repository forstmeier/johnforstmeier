This piece is on _Bad Blood_ [[1](https://www.amazon.com/Bad-Blood-Secrets-Silicon-Startup/dp/0525431993/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3KSDY7EGVIUYQ&dchild=1&keywords=bad+blood&qid=1609853534&s=books&sprefix=bad+blood%2Caps%2C160&sr=1-1 "Bad Blood - Amazon")] by John Carreyrou [[2](https://twitter.com/JohnCarreyrou "John Carreyrou - Twitter")].

I was familiar with the story of Elizabeth Holmes [[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes "Elizabeth Holmes - Wikipedia")] and her company Theranos [[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos "Theranos - Wikipedia")] but the book provided greater insight into how she interacted with people regarding her work.

It is unclear whether her extreme focus on "her mission" was a manipulative effort or actual self-denial; her actions could support both positions.

There are many instances of Holmes legally pursuing whistleblowers and publicly attacking external detractors - essentially anyone threatening the positive perception of Theranos. _This seems to support a more **manipulative** scenario_.

Within the company, parallels are found where Holmes would physically give employees a cold shoulder for lack of enthusiasm or lambasting them for perceived lapses in loyalty. _These internal episodes point towards **self-denial** - shutting out anything that conflicts with her perception of reality_.

To me, it's inconclusive but the latter would be a more interesting situation.
