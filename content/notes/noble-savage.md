Sometimes prior stages of human development are presented as a model to emulate with claims the early _homo_ genuses better coexisted with their natural environment.

Contrary evidence [[1](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.693.9335&rep=rep1&type=pdf "A Multispecies Overkill Simulation of the End-Pleistocene Megafaunal Mass Extinction - Alroy")] indicates early humans directly contributed to megafaunal extinction events across the globe; the correlative findings show mass extinctions were immediately preceeded by the arrival of migrating humans. Other factors may have contributed but these were not as significant as the presence of human hunters.

Modern human overall situational awareness and action taken regarding environmental conservation are significant improvements over our predecessors.

Returning to the imgae of the "noble savage" is not productive or realistic.
