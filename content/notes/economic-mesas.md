A **citizen's dividend** would create an "economic mesa" and establish a natural and humane border.

Following the Georgist [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism#Revenue_uses "Georgism revenue uses - Wikipedia")] model, a citizen's dividend would have the side effect of providing an additional method for defining and enforcing sovereign territory. Legal citizens would receive the non-guaranteed dividend, pro rata, which would generally shift prices higher in the region they spend it - predominantly where they live. A resource disparity would arise between the citizens and the citizens of neighboring countries. Individuals entering the country would not be entitled to the dividend and would face the hurdle of the "economic mesa" in order to live within the national borders which would encourage legal immigration.
