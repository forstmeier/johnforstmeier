- collection writings + talks jeff bezos
- astoundingly clear look into mind
- especially shareholder letters

- personal favorites
- "making decisions" 2005
- highlights rational vs instinctual
- data vs gut decision making
- former reliable, latter impactful
- "working backward" 2008
- pushing innovation + avoiding stagnation
- combat complacency w/ core goals over existing competencies
- overall roadmap build company culture
- key seems be focus few tenants
- nore merely lay out
