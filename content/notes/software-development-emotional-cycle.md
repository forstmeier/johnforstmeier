Writing software typically occurs in rapid iterations and can have a similarly rapid emotional cycle attached to the work. Personally, this can be mapped to **confidence over time** in the plot below.

The pattern goes something like this:

- confidence increases as software is shipped
- something breaks which halts the rising confidence
- "Why did I ever choose to work in software?" => _self-loathing_
- confidence moves lower while the problem is worked on
- something fixes the problem bottoming the drop
- "Why did I think I could do this?" => _imposter syndrome_
- and then the cycle repeats itself

This is a tongue-in-cheek representation, but in actuality, I think a mature developer recognizes this and takes steps to keep the slopes flat as possible.
