While I don't agree with *most* philosophic and religious traditions, I can't imagine a world that is better where Great Meteoron, Potala Palace, Shaolin Temple, Simonopetra, Blagaj Tekke, Sera Monastery, Tungnath, and many others, are silent. I really believe these monuments, and the faiths that they symbolize, to be important to our shared social fabric and our connection to our past.

The beauty and diversity of antique philosophy should be fought for and maintained.
