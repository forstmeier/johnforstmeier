Anecdotally, the demand for skilled physical labor is outpacing supply.

Technological advances and the distributist [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributism "Distributism - Wikipedia")] philosophy are well-positioned to work in tandem in this scenario.

Providing _direct_ ownership over machinery, robotics, and software that leverages the skilled laborer's abilities encourages participation and increases productivity.

Bringing together these skilled individual owners under a separately owned but _centrally_ organized factory would allow for optimal coordination of these resources.

Essentially **individuals** contribute their owned productive resources which are optimized by an **orchestration** resource.

> Individual ownership, collective orchestration.
