Some companies rely heavily on social capital as part of their continued financial success. To varying degrees, this makes them dependent on current social trends.

However, even companies that are _not_ overly impacted by social perception (e.g. ones with strong customer stickiness) seem to seek it out. In doing so they appear to voluntarily relinquish an advantageous position.

Maybe there is or always has been a strong need to "belong" even in profit-driven enterprises. This seems like a mistake.
