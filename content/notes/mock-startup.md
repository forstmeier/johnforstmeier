Startups combine grand visions with lean situations which require functional **mocks** to be introduced to build the project.

These mocks can be applied to three major startup areas.

**Minimum viable product (MVP)**

MVPs expose the smallest possible surface area capturing real usage to test the product hypothesis with minimal resource outlay.

Both software and hardware startups can mock most functionality with simple scripts, manual processes, or existing customer actions.

| Startup | Example |
|---|---|
| Cloud seeding | Build software consolidating data identifying optimal seed targets and guide existing initiatives accordingly |
| Aerospace assembly | Build software optimizing assembly instructions and keep existing sourcing and assembly with existing producers |

**Minimum viable customer (MVC)**

MVCs establish the slightest relationship with the startup capable of generating value.

They fit a targeted, niche profile and provide value through discussions and feedback - actual contracts and payments are mocked.

| Startup | Example |
|---|---|
| Cloud seeding | Water regulators and pilots divulging pain points and inefficiencies |
| Aerospace assembly | Drone manufacturer seeking increased output to generate new revenue lines from increased drone availability |

**Minimum viable investor (MVI)**

MVIs provide resources to expand the project.

Specific investors with appropriate networks help MVPs connect with MVCs without writing a check.

The check should not be implemented until there is an absolute need for cash or is necessary to scale.

| Startup | Example |
|---|---|
| Cloud seeding | Provides chemical experts and university connections for testing grounds |
| Aerospace assembly | Introduces to portfolio companies benefiting from increased manufacturing throughput |

> Startups move quickly and deliver things.
