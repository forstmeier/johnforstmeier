The theory of distributism [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributism "Distributism - Wikipedia")] encourages maker ownership of the means and output of production while maintaining a free market. Together, this makes for a system designed around individual self-direction and establishes human dignity at the center of the philosophy.

A move towards distributism is a move towards a **true system of social justice**.
