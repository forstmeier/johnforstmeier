Maximizing productive output while maintaining individual rights and dignity is the primary concern in an increasingly automated workforce system. Open source caters to this scenario and provides hyper-productive individuals with a series of resources to leverage their output and effectively provide for consumers.

**Benefits**

- Common knowledge pool: shared and open intellectual property which reduces "reinvention" by participants creating proprietary alternatives
- Non-overlapping markets: entities focus on "peripheral" markets surrounding shared core resources which encourages focus on competitive advantages
- Lower entry barriers: new participants can enter market rapidly as core intellectual property is openly available for use
- Value creation prioritization: more value is created from open resources than is captured by each individual producer
- Balances market forces: monopolization and perfect competition are avoided through public core resources and competitive advantage focuses
- Supply chain cooperation: "niche" edge producers collaborating between individual horizontal and vertical segments
- Adaptive technologies: common core resources with multiple contributors provides rapid updates for changing environments/requirements

Consumers benefit in this scenario of a hyper-productive minority operating in a highly automated workforce through more rapid innovation and product development.

> Open source allows hyper-productive individuals to use tools and resources best suited to leverage their productivity.
