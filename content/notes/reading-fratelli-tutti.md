This is a breakdown of the encyclical _Fratelli Tutti_ [[1](http://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html "Fratelli Tutti")] written by Pope Francis.

The encyclical covers a wide range of topics and displays a generally more political tone while attempting to balance diverging viewpoints. Sometimes this leads to over-simplification or self-contradiction.

This note primarily discusses socio-economic subjects and reference numbers are provided for the appropriate sections of the encyclical.

| Topic | Summary | Comments |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Culture | Exporting or copying cultural models reduces national identity (#51) and different cultures are not enemies (#147). | This ignores that some cultures are objectively better at protecting human rights (e.g. abolishing slavery). | 
| Immigration | Improve origin nations to reduce unnecessary migration and avoid building welfare programs for migrants (#129) but establish comprehensive programs for necessary migration situations (#130). | Somewhat contradictory program scope points; providing local-level assistance and exporting state-level national improvements is likely a better and more targeted approach. |
| Localism | Globalism erodes national identity (#12), focus scope from local to global (#78), avoid universal, central planning (#100), balance nationalism and humanitarianism (#149), local organizations are more knowledgeable in local situations than global organizations are (#175). | Local problem solving better accounts for risk and resource assessments and avoids "one size fits all" solutions. |
| Economics | Reducing labor cost in production can produce negative consequences (#20), consumerism is destructive (#36), opportunities should include assistance to vulnerable individuals (#108), economics must not supersede human rights (#122), markets cannot solve all problems (#168). | Correctly states that economics must be human-centric and markets cannot solve all problems; however there are over-simplifications since reduced product costs make resources more available (e.g. cheaper food) and advance better technology (e.g. from coal to nuclear energy). |
| Poverty | Wealth has increased along with inequality and new forms of poverty (#21). | This point ignores that absolute poverty has drastically declined in recent decades. [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_poverty#:~:text=The%20percentage%20of%20the%20global,and%201.2%20billion%20in%202008 "Extreme poverty - Wikipedia")] |
| Individualism | Waiting for government-provided opportunities is irresponsible (#77), community relationships enrich self-definition (#89), equality does not induce fraternity (#103), individual differences build cultures (#218). | Unique individuals with charitable hearts working collaboratively build the strongest social fabrics; similar strength cannot be produced by legislative dictates. |
| Charity | Charity cannot be issued through one solution and must be through individual action (#165), moral formation drives individual charity (#167), and legislation can establish charity (#186). | The first two points conflict with the last which favors top-down solutions rather than individually-driven charitable interaction. |
| Borders | Borders cannot exclude resource access (#121 and #124), prosperous nations should support needy nations (#125). | Disolving borders reduces local self-determination by removing a citizen's right to their produced resources but arbitrary migration restrictions are also unproductive. A more "natural" border could be established via a citizen's dividend. [[3](https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/economic-mesas-1-0/ "Economic Mesas - Forstmeier")]. |
| Work | Economic goal of no stragglers (#110), using talents in work is noble (#123), and dignity is found in work (#162). |  Somewhat utopian in vision and will likely never be realized but points regarding self-sufficiency and "noble work" are practically achievable. |
| Nuclear Weapons | Peace and trust cannot be established through threat of violence (#262). | While trust may not be built, peace certainly can - nuclear proliferation has coincided with decreased intensity of violent conflicts. [[4](https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/uploads/Rauchhaus_Evaluating_the_Nuclear_Peace.pdf "Evaluating the Nuclear Peace Hypothesis: A Quantitative Approach - Rauchhaus")]. |
| Indigenous Peopls | Natives are less violent and more egalitarian (#220). | This conflicts with history; in the Americas tribal and imperial warfare was common as were their prehistoric contributions to early megafaunal exinctions. [[5](https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/noble-savage-1-0/ "Noble Savage - Forstmeier")] |
| Public Order | Law enforcment is required in charitable societies (#164). | Safety and community organization cannot exist without a shared, enforced legal framework. |
| Private Property | All humans are shared stewards of world natural resources (#120). | This is in-line with Georgism [[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism "Georgism - Wikipedia")] without denying the right to personally produced products. |

<!-- Unpublished topics

| History | Remember your history (#13), accept painful events (#226), seek authentic reconciliation (#244). | Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it. |
| Communication | Dialogue has become destructive confrontation (#15), technology created thought bubbles (#45), discreditation has superseded discussion (#201), and imposing will versus collaboration is the end goal (#202). | Technology has been misused and severely damaged dialogue but can be used to rectify the situation if approached correctly. | 
| Forgiveness | Social-level pardons are not possible and must be done on the individual-level (#246). | This objects to obligatory actions of group forgiveness and highlights the inability to forgive in the name of others. |
| Science | Information is not wisdom (#50) and greater scientific interdisciplinary communication is encouraged (#204). | Maintaining an open perspective is important especially in rigorous scientific fields. | -->
