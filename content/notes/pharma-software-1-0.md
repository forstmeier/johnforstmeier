Some characteristics of pharmaceuticals make them comparable to software. Basically software and pharmaceuticals have:

- high development costs
- low distribution costs

For example, both require a large, upfront resource investment in research and composition. After initial R&D expenses, both are relatively easily manufactured and distributed at scale.

Knowing this, pharmaceuticals may be well placed to leverage wide-reaching treatments while reducing healthcare costs. Additionally, with precision medicine [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine#Drug_development_and_usage)], highly-focused solutions can be developed or even compounded on-demand for individual use to increase effectiveness.

Risks to consider are that while pharmaceuticals and software may share characteristics, they are _not_ the same in execution - human risks are significantly higher in the medical space than those typically found in software and this should not be discounted.
