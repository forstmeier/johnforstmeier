Impressionism [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism "Impressionism - Wikipedia")] as a painting style has a strong personal, albeit uninformed, appeal.

The style prefers to see _everything_ in a given scope without focusing on _specific_ details. Produced images are more of a summary or a simplification of the subject which significantly reduces cognitive overhead in consuming these pieces.

A favorite is _The Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama_ [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle_of_the_Kearsarge_and_the_Alabama "The Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama - Wikipedia")] by Ã‰douard Manet, pictured below.

**Personal highlights**:

- smoke obscuring ship details or entire vessels
- quick lines for distant masts and rigging
- approximately two-thirds is water most of which is empty
- no specifics are conveyed on people in the image
