A typical modern stance is to "own nothing" enhanced by the move into a service-based economy.

While this may sound appealing and anti-materialistic, it diverges entirely from genuine austerity - something expressed wholly in Catholic monastic orders.

Whereas the modern world urges _non-ownership_, the monastics eschew _having anything_ at all.

The conflation is damaging and seeks to cheapen the greater calling of those true ascetics.
