My own philosophy is a combination of **futurist** and **traditionalist** perspectives.

Both _progressive_ and _conservative_.

I revere and retain our shared histories and traditions while simultaneously cultivating and creating our future and forward progress.

> After all, what are we preserving the past for if not for the future?
