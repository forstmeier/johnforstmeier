Anecdotally to the observer, it seems that _national_ adversity produces **heroes** while _personal_ adversity produces **victims**.

> Why is there a perceived difference and why can't personal adversity produce public heroes?

In national-level issues, everyone is impacted and all shoulder the burden while a few rise as leaders. For example, in World War II individuals such as Churchill [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill "Winston Churchill - Wikipedia")], Murphy [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audie_Murphy "Audie Murphy - Wikipedia")], Winters [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Winters "Richard Winters - Wikipedia")], and Sendler [[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irena_Sendler "Irena Sendler")] are rightfully treated as heroes for their noble defense of freedom even as the conflict touched all lives.

On the other side, personal-level issues that impact a population subset but are treated as if everyone should bear the load and that no one individual may be a hero. Poverty, hunger, addiction - things people and fight against and even overcome. Resilience in the face of personal struggle somehow feels as though it's not recognized as a heroic act.
