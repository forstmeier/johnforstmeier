The individuals best suited for making decisions on any solution are those closest to the problem. It is the leader's only job to facilitate these decisions. A leader should:

- Provide guidance when it is requested
- Arbitrate disputes when they arise
- Make decisions when presented options
- Spread vision and purpose when leading

Leaders should work to empower individuals to make their own decisions and only impose their own when absolutely necessary.

**To lead is to serve.**
