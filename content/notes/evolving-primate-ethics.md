If we assume that non-human primates are experiencing evolutionary growth we may eventually face similar questions to those Lewis raises in _Religion and Rocketry_ [[1](https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/reading-religion-and-rocketry/ "Reading: Religion and Rocketry - Forstmeier")].

- For example, can the primates have evolved to the point they have received the divine spark of an immortal soul endowed with reason?
- If so, are they fallen, pre-fallen, post-fallen, or some other state we are not aware of?
- And what is our responsibility towards our newly-elevated evolutionary cousins?

I don't have answers - only questions.
