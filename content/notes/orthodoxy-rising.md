This post reflects a general personal sense - I've looked for no data to back up the position. It's purely an observation and prediction based on gut. That statement is:

> The current political and social climate is turning my generation towards tradition.

Being inundated with polarization while simultaneously being drawn into diametrically opposed systems of _hyper-individualism_ and _hyper-collectivism_ has been socially destructive. Individualism destroys **meaning** while collectivism destroys **agency**.

And a silent objection to those alternatives is appearing. A noble rebellion of orthodoxy. An orthodoxy of immutable truth and tradition to be sought through individual struggle and collective support.

A generation is falling upwards into tradition.
