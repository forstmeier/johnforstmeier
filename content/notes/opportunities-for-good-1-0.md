Something that strikes me:

> Small opportunities to be good seem so difficult to take advantage of while the truly great require no deliberation.

I wonder if this has to do with smaller opportunities so often coming into conflict with prevailing social norms while the options that accompany truly great opportunities are universally held to be true. Now this isn't to say the small are lesser but that accomplishing them requires a different kind of courage.
