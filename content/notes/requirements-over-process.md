Favor requirements over processes while building. When you do need a process, automate it.

By this I mean prioritize *quality* or *production* requirements rather than dictating _how_ to build things. Creating process pipelines, or enforcing strict architectures before they can be evaluated, likely stifles creativity - anything needing a process should be automated and never thought about.

Basically: **let people be creative** and then when they've built some cool things, **formalize and automate the things that prevent them from being creative**.
