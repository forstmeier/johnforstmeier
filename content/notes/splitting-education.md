Currently, there is a conflation between higher education and vocational training. Typical, four-year degrees are providing both a general education and serving as credentialing frequently required in the workforce. Separating these aspects could provide more tailored services to students based on interest and need.

**Educational**

- "traditional" four-year college environment
- providing broad teachings and exposure to abstract concepts
- examples: history, higher-order math, music, computer theory, etc.

> \> more theoretical, less appied

**Vocational**

- "vocational" work preparation environment
- providing specific training and concepts useful in the workplace
- examples: accounting, architecture, heavy machinery, coding, etc.

> \> more applied, less theoretical

With these options offered separately, maybe each as a maximum two-year option, students could mix-and-match based on their own needs. Those who want to work emphasize the vocational while those with the time and interest can dive into the educational.
