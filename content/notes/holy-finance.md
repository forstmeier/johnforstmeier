Modern finance is a powerful, indirect tool for forward progress.

However, it often succumbs to greed and aravice or is hijacked by anti-growth systems like ESG [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance "Environmental, social, and corporate governance - Wikipedia")].

This pulls finance away from its greater potential; ways must be found to align finance with noble initiatives. And not just align, but indirectly contribute to through efficient and effective asset allocation.

Utilizing self-interest to accelerate growth and galvanize action with a pro-human mindset is a challenge but one worth tackling.
