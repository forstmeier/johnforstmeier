Below is another loose collection of ideas to improve U.S. political function.

**Ideas**

1. **Git-tracked legislation**: while developing legislation, changes introduced by different members should be tracked in Git or a Git-like platform that would allow exact `blame` to be attributed. Additionally, this could be overlayed with political donation records to know exactly what influences there were. Note that this is basically if there are no single-issue bills available.

> Goal: exact legislative attribution.

2. **Single-issue political platforms**: ad hoc parties formed for hyper-specific purposes. Essentially “one and done” operations put forward specific legislation and endorse candidates that pledge to enact it. After completion, they disband.

> Goal: outcome-oriented initiatives with broader party appeal.

3. **Single-issue legislation**: this is a longstanding goal of many current politicians but it’s worth reiterating in this list.

> Goal: simple and understandable legislation.

4. **Single-payout financial distributions**: any legislation requiring financial payouts must be done in tandem, and only once, with it being passed. This means payouts cannot carry over into the future.

> Goal: explicit “re-upping” for financial distributions and capped requisitions.
