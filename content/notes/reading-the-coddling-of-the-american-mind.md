This is a brief summary of _The Coddling of the American Mind_ [[1](https://www.amazon.com/Coddling-American-Mind-Intentions-Generation/dp/0735224919/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+coddling+of+the+american+mind&qid=1621255121&sr=8-1)] by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt.

In short, it is a well developed, explained, and supported book that is heavily data-driven. Overall, the book is critical of the "safetyism" which is increasingly present in society and encourages building more resillient members of the broader community.

The authors highlight specific issues in how the younger generations (at the time of its writing) are being raised and present targeted solutions that parents may act upon. The book would be a good resource for anyong working with or raising children.
