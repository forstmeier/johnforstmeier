Another wonderful example of impressionism [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressionism "Impressionism - Wikipedia")] by Manet [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ã‰douard_Manet "Edouard Manet - Wikipedia")] is "Tarring a Boat" [[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarring_a_Boat "Tarring a Boat - Wikipedia")].

**Personal highlights**

- ship inner details are expressed but not defined
- interesting strokes for the anchor in the foreground
- no specifics are conveyed on people in the image
