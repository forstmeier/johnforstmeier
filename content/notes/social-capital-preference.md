Some companies rely heavily on social capital as part of their continued financial success. To varying degrees, this makes them dependent on current social trends.

However, even companies that are _not_ overly impacted by social perception (e.g. ones with strong customer stickiness) seem to seek it out. In doing so they appear to voluntarily relinquish an advantageous position.

> Why take on an unnecessary dependency?

Maybe there is or always has been a strong need to "belong" even in profit-driven enterprises. This seems like a mistake.
