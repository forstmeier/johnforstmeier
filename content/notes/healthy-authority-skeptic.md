Being a healthy skeptic of authority is a good thing. The keyword being **healthy**.

A certain amount of structure is definitely necessary to enable human socio-economic interactions. But evaluations of the structure should be constantly made:

- Evaluate the *validity* of the those in authority - does their position of power stem from the governed?
- Evaluate whether their actions fall within the *purview* of those in authority - are they doing what they have the capacity to do on behalf of the governed?
