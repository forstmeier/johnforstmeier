Rapid development iteration following patterns like Agile [[1](http://www.agilenutshell.com/ "What is Agile? - Agile In A Nutshell")] generates immediate product feedback which may be an antidote against not posessing raw talent displayed by people like Steve Wozniak [[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Wozniak "Steve Wozniak - Wikipedia")].

Avoiding "representing yourself" [[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJif4i9NRdI "Steve Wozniak Debunks One of Apple's Biggest Myths - YouTube")] in the product removes the need to build perfection on the first deployment and will still eventually lead to a fully realized end result.
