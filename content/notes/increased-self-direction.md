The goal of increased individual self-direction requires providing both the *individual decision-making capacity* and the *resources to take action with*.

This is a personal goal of mine to provide both of these factors for both myself in my own life and for others in theirs. Individuals should be maximally free to self-direct and be able to utilize as many resources as possible, in many cases, to engage in productive endeavors.
