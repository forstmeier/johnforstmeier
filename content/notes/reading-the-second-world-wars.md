There are several interesting takeaways from Victor Davis Hanson's _The Second World Wars_ [[1](https://www.amazon.com/Second-World-Wars-Global-Conflict/dp/0465066984 "The Second World Wars - Amazon")]. The whole work is presented from a numerical viewpoint and basically offers "accountant's lessons" from the war. Here are some that stood out to me.

> Emphasize support resources

- Massive production of basic support vehicles and robust supply lines were a constant focus for the Allies throughout the war
- "Boring" things like unarmed and unarmored trucks were essential in ensuring sustainable campaigning

> Produce fewer similar models

- Axis powers often focused on building next-generation weaponry which necessitated significant development costs and iteration cycles
- Producing fewer models of solid-quality equipment was more cost effective and efficient

> Accommodate soldier profiles

- Understanding what makes the soldiers "tick" and adjusting what resources are provided accordingly is a strategic advantage
- Knowing that many U.S. servicemen were midwestern farmers accustomed to mechanical work meant giving them tools that they could tinker with and maintain was a long-term sustainability investment
