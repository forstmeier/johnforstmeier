I've made several venture-style investments so far as an entry-level angel. Below is the initial portfolio.

**Calm Company Fund** [[1](https://calmfund.com/ "Calm Company Fund - Calm Company Fund")]: This was a crowdfunded campaign for the fund company which invests in revenue-generating startups. It's the most thesis-driven position I've taken so far as it aligns with my belief that SaaS companies should generate revenue immediately.

**Vuecason** [[3](https://www.vuecason.com/ "Vuecason - Vuecason")]: In addition to the fascinating technology, the overall vibe compatibility drove this investment. My posts online drew the syndicate leader's attention leading her to solicit my investment. Additionally, the co-founder's overall worldview and problem-solving approach he presented online resonated with me.

**Valar Atomics** [[4](https://www.valaratomics.com/ "Valar Atomics - Valar Atomics")]: There was a similar vibe-based connection here as well as my longstanding interest in nuclear energy. [[5](https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/georgism-and-energy/ "Georgism and Energy - John Forstmeier")] I also found the arbitrage of energy format, nuclear to hydrocarbon, to be a particularly interesting market-based position to place the company in.
