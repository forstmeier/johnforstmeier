An approach I've been thinking about is something I'm dubbing the **"FAFO Method"** or **"fuck around, find out"**.

Basically, this boils down to:

1. Learn the minimum about an idea to be dangerous
2. Quickly iterate and implement the idea

It's not quite a "see what sticks" method because you still want to evaluate and prioritize _how_ you spend your time prior to spending it. And then on top of that, you want to _minimize_ the time actually spent doing the thing.

When building a product, and if this is done right, I think you could avoid market research and just get something in front of people rapidly and then go from there.
