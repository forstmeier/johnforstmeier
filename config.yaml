  about:
    - I'm a senior software engineer and the first hire at Shipyard. On nights and weekends I'm building Pocket Size Fund as a side project. I've made several angel investments and plan on making more. In my spare time I enjoy reading and lifting.
    - I'm pro-West, pro-growth, and pro-human.
    - This website's content edits can be found in its public GitHub repository.
