<h2>Political Brainstorm No. 1</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2020-10-15</p>
	<p><p>Below is a loose, unordered collection of &ldquo;radical&rdquo;, but practically implementable, ideas for the U.S. political system. These have not been evaluated for completeness - this is a braindump. However, they may be expanded on individually in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Ideas</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Comprehensive Federal term limits</strong>: all Federal-level roles, including the Vice Presidency, the Senate, the House, and the Supreme Court, would be term-limited. Service could be potentially capped at eight years each.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Goal: reducing influence consolidation and office permanence.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Non-elected public roles appointed by elected officials</strong>: all non-elected roles would be appointed at the discretion of an elected role - which elected officials would oversee which appointments would need to be established.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Goal: preventing non-elected roles becoming permanently held.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Non-salaried elected office</strong>: elected individuals would finance their offices via a) self-funding through personal savings b) political campaign donations.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Goal: foster non-political experience and smaller staffs.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Remove non-personal political donations</strong>: all donations would be made by individuals and all political expenditures would be directly made by the candidate&rsquo;s campaign. PACs and similar operations would not be available.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Goal: close loopholes and reduce financial influence.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Increase individual donation limit</strong>: raise the cap [<a href="https://www.fec.gov/help-candidates-and-committees/candidate-taking-receipts/contribution-limits/" title="Contribution limits - Federal Election Commission">1</a>] on what voters may put towards individual candidate campaigns. Possibly balance this with placing limits on the number of campaigns that could be donated to. Identifying a non-arbitrary rule would be a central focus.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Goal: leveling financial dispartiy influence on elections.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Remove Presidential executive orders</strong>: or significantly reduce the ability to immediately execute orders or decrease their functional scope. Finding a non-arbitrary constraint would be ideal.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Goal: reducing focus on and importance of executive office.</p>
