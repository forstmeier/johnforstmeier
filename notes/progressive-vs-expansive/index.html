<h2>Progressive vs Expansive</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2021-03-19</p>
	<p><p>The term &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; has been conflated with the word &ldquo;expansive&rdquo; with regards to legislative initiatives. In some ways, this is similar to the theme in Peter Thiel&rsquo;s [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel" title="Peter Thiel - Wikipedia">1</a>] book <em>Zero to One</em> [<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/0804139296/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1A6QLH3ITBA8X&amp;dchild=1&amp;keywords=zero+to+one&amp;qid=1615985599&amp;sprefix=zero+to+one%2Caps%2C153&amp;sr=8-1" title="Zero to One - Amazon">2</a>].</p>
<ul>
<li>moving 0 -&gt; 1 creates an entirely new solution</li>
<li>moving 1 -&gt; N scales an existing solution</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter is dominant while being billed as the former in legislation. Currently, this is particularly true in two areas: <strong>minimum wage</strong> and <strong>college education</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum wage</strong></p>
<p>Setting aside the typically cited issues that setting or increasing a minimum wage reduces available jobs, another perspective can be taken.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most minimum wage jobs are low-skill and the labor element is highly interchangeable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Essentially, anyone could pick up these roles. By setting a minimum wage, this position is basically stating that these jobs should be permanent by artificially making them increasingly financially viable.</p>
<p>However, a more progressive strategy would be to encourage better jobs and training to remove reliance on low-skill roles. The progressive approach should be to remove these jobs entirely as a permanent source of employment.</p>
<p><strong>College education</strong></p>
<p>This topic has been previously touched on in prior notes [<a href="https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/progressive-education/" title="Progressive Education - Forstmeier">3</a>][<a href="https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/student-value-extraction/" title="Student Value Extraction - Forstmeier">4</a>][<a href="https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/splitting-education/" title="Splitting Education - Forstmeier">5</a>] and a summary note is worth including. Currently the progressive approach is to <em>expand</em> enrollment without questioning its modern value.</p>
<p>An actually progressive strategy would be to both identify whether college is appropriate for job training and whether alternative education means are more effective. Accounting for costs and benefits in a changing landscape is forward looking.</p>
<p>There is also a contradiction between holding these dual positions of college education and minimum wage - the former theoretically helps avoid minimum wage jobs while the latter encourages holding minimum wage jobs.</p>
<p>In these two examples, the theme is <em>expanding</em> a solution as opposed to <em>progressing</em> to a new one.</p>
