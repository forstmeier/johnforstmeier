<h2>Some Investments</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2024-03-11</p>
	<p><p>I&rsquo;ve made several venture-style investments as an entry-level angel. Below is the initial portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Calm Company Fund</strong> [<a href="https://calmfund.com/" title="Calm Company Fund - Calm Company Fund">1</a>]: This was a crowdfunded campaign for the fund company which invests in revenue-generating startups. It&rsquo;s the most thesis-driven stake I&rsquo;ve taken so far as it aligns with my position that SaaS companies should generate revenue immediately given their low barrier to entry. [<a href="https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/bootstrapped-vs-backed/" title="Bootstrapped vs Backed - John Forstmeier">2</a>]</p>
<p><strong>Vuecason</strong> [<a href="https://www.vuecason.com/" title="Vuecason - Vuecason">3</a>]: In addition to the fascinating technology, the overall vibe compatibility drove this investment. My posts online drew the syndicate leader&rsquo;s attention leading her to solicit my investment. Additionally, the co-founder&rsquo;s overall worldview and problem-solving approach he presented online resonated with me.</p>
<p><strong>Valar Atomics</strong> [<a href="https://www.valaratomics.com/" title="Valar Atomics - Valar Atomics">4</a>]: There was a similar vibe-based connection here as well as my longstanding interest in nuclear energy. [<a href="https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/georgism-and-energy/" title="Georgism and Energy - John Forstmeier">5</a>] I also found the arbitrage of energy format, nuclear to hydrocarbon, to be a particularly fascinating market-based engine to place the company on.</p>
<p><strong>Forager Station</strong> [<a href="https://www.foragerstation.com/" title="Forager Station - Forager Station">5</a>]: The investment was sourced via an inbound connection from Twitter and was fascinating for its potential to revive orphaned natural gas wells. This aspect was particularly appealing given my interest in investing in companies that would directly benefit my home state Pennsylvania.</p>
