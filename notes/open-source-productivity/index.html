<h2>Note - Open Source Productivity</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2019-07-16</p>
	<p><p>Maximizing productive output while maintaining individual rights and dignity is the primary concern in an increasingly automated workforce system. Open source caters to this scenario and provides hyper-productive individuals with a series of resources to leverage their output and effectively provide for consumers.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Common knowledge pool: shared and open intellectual property which reduces &ldquo;reinvention&rdquo; by participants creating proprietary alternatives</li>
<li>Non-overlapping markets: entities focus on &ldquo;peripheral&rdquo; markets surrounding shared core resources which encourages focus on competitive advantages</li>
<li>Lower entry barriers: new participants can enter market rapidly as core intellectual property is openly available for use</li>
<li>Value creation prioritization: more value is created from open resources than is captured by each individual producer</li>
<li>Balances market forces: monopolization and perfect competition are avoided through public core resources and competitive advantage focuses</li>
<li>Supply chain cooperation: &ldquo;niche&rdquo; edge producers collaborating between individual horizontal and vertical segments</li>
<li>Adaptive technologies: common core resources with multiple contributors provides rapid updates for changing environments/requirements</li>
</ul>
<p>Consumers benefit in this scenario of a hyper-productive minority operating in a highly automated workforce through more rapid innovation and product development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Open source allows hyper-productive individuals to use tools and resources best suited to leverage their productivity.</p>
