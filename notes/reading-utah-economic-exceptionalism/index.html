<h2>Note - Reading: Utah’s Economic Exceptionalism</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2021-01-18</p>
	<p><p>Several aspects of the Beehive State&rsquo;s socio-economic approach are discussed in an article titled &ldquo;Utah’s Economic Exceptionalism&rdquo; [<a href="https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2020/11/utahs-economic-exceptionalism/" title="Utah's Economic Exceptionalism - American Affairs">1</a>] by Natalie Gochnour.</p>
<p>While the state&rsquo;s economic position was solid during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, both in terms of mitigating negative fallout and general rising economic performance, the basis for this success appears to have been in place well prior to the outbreak.</p>
<p>The article points to factors like low income disparity, high upward mobility, and even highly unusual feats such as under budget and early completion in major public works projects as indicators of the state&rsquo;s favorable economic strategy.</p>
<p>These successes are attributed to the concept of &ldquo;social capital&rdquo; here specifically meaning to trust built between individuals as well as individuals and their local institutions. This in turn is rooted in the religious and non-profit organizations througout the state which adhere to compassionate outreach versus top-down mandates.</p>
