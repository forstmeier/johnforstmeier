<h2>Note - Georgism and Energy</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2020-09-17</p>
	<p><p>The <strong>land value tax</strong> (&ldquo;LVT&rdquo;) at the center of Georgism directly encourages efficient land usage in energy production. Given that this core principal assesses taxes as a percentage of the value of the land held, it drives producers to establish the smallest physical footprint possible.</p>
<p>If it were introduced, there would be an immediate impact to all existing energy producers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Traditional&rdquo; fuels (e.g. oil, LNG, coal)</strong>: large land, and potentially offshore, resources would be adjusted to find the optimal boundary of exerting exclusive rights to the resources and minimizing the taxable land held; additionally the valuable resources held in the land would increase the land value and taxes owed.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Alternative&rdquo; energy (e.g. wind, solar, hydro)</strong>: adjustments would be made to try and optimally position collection facilities; while the land would potentially be less expensive than those containing fuel reserves, the large land requirements for renewables would likely create an increased tax base.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, <em><strong>nuclear-based</strong></em> energy solutions would likely benefit given their significantly smaller footprint and generally fewer natural resource requirements. [<a href="https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/current-and-future-generation/cooling-power-plants.aspx" title="Cooling Power Plants - World Nuclear Association">1</a>] This means that reactors, particularly newer generations [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reactor#Generation_IV_reactors" title="Generation IV reactors - Wikipedia">2</a>] or small modular reactors (&ldquo;SMR&rdquo;) [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_modular_reactor" title="Small modular reactor - Wikipedia">3</a>], could be more flexibly positioned. Coupling this with their minimal emissions and steady output make nuclear plants an ideal energy production candidate under a Georgist philosphy.</p>
<p>Georgism encourages:</p>
<ul>
<li>optimal land usage</li>
<li>responsible environmental stewardship</li>
</ul>
<p>Both principles point to nuclear as an attractive energy source.</p>
