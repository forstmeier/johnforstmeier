<h2>Note - Reading: Religion and Rocketry</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2021-02-24</p>
	<p><p>The short essay &ldquo;Religion and Rocketry&rdquo; from C.S. Lewis&rsquo; [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._S._Lewis" title="C.S. Lewis - Wikipedia">1</a>] collection <em>The World&rsquo;s Last Night</em> [<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Last-Night-Other-Essays/dp/0156027712" title="The World's Last Night - Amazon">2</a>] addresses the existence of extraterrestrial life.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s interesting about this piece is that it takes their existence for granted and digs into the theological and ethical implications their existence entails. Lewis poses a series of questions regarding their spiritual nature - two in particular ask whether the aliens are <strong>fallen</strong>, as we are, and what, if any, mechanism exists for their <strong>redemption</strong>.</p>
<p>This, to me, is an unexpected and interesting perspective. It&rsquo;s not <em>what if</em> they exist or <em>why</em> they exist - it&rsquo;s much more than that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the state of their <strong>soul</strong> and what must be done to <strong>protect or redeem</strong> it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to discuss these points throughout the essay but it raises a parallel situation. In a similar manner, if we take the eventual creation of general artificial intelligence as a given, and it attains both consciousness and a soul, <em>what is the construct&rsquo;s state of <strong>grace</strong></em>?</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it fallen and must be redeemed?</li>
<li>Can it fall and how should we protect it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Lewis raises immense questions.</p>
