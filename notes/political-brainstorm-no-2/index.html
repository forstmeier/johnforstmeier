<h2>Note - Political Brainstorm No. 2</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2021-10-07</p>
	<p><p>Here are some more loose ideas on simple ways to potentially improve the U.S. political system.</p>
<p><strong>Ideas</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Quantifiable legislative goals</strong>: during campaigns, politicians should pledge, or maybe even be required, to set out a handful of specific policy goals with quantifiable outcomes (and preset measurement criteria). If these goals were met, assuming a successful election, they could run again after their term expires.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Goal: move elections towards data-driven performers.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Campaign finance simplification</strong>: only allow personal donations with a maximum donation amount - this could mirror the fact that each citizen only gets one vote and financial disparities should not come into play.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Goal: reducing financial influence on elections.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Donation-based salaries</strong>: elected officials and their staffs draw their salaries from their donation pools alone without federal funding. Exceptions could potentially be made for providing services like security or official engagement transport.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Goal: preventing politicians from manipulating their own salaries.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>War chest management</strong>: this may already exist but political candidates could set a predefined distribution strategy for their accummulated donations in the event of a campaign loss (e.g. naming a charitable organization in their consituency as a beneficiary if the campaign fails and disclose this to donors).</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Goal: improving visibility into donation usage.</p>
</blockquote>
