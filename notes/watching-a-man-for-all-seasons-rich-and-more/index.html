<h2>Watching: A Man for All Seasons - Rich and More</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2022-12-29</p>
	<p><p>Some of the most compelling scenes in <em>A Man for All Seasons</em> [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Man_for_All_Seasons_(1966_film)" title="A Man for All Seasons (1996 film) - Wikipedia">1</a>] are between Saint Thomas More [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_More" title="Thomas More - Wikipedia">2</a>] and Richard Rich [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rich,_1st_Baron_Rich" title="Richard Rich, 1st Baron Rich - Wikipedia">3</a>]. Each chronicles the gradual fall of the latter while the former remains stalwart.</p>
<p>Below are some of the more notable interactions.</p>
<ol>
<li>Nortfolk asks More about Rich and if he recommends him which More declines - already the importance More puts on his word is being highlighted.</li>
<li>More offers Rich a teaching role and counsels against going where he will be tempted - this indicates that More is not tempted by the powers of higher office and predicts Rich&rsquo;s later choices.</li>
<li>Rich begs More for a position which More refuses - More&rsquo;s strategic care comes into conflict with Rich&rsquo;s ambitious weakness.</li>
<li>More&rsquo;s various interrogations by Cromwell and others are observed by Rich - these juxtapose their choices leading to ongoing hardships and immediate rewards, respectively.</li>
<li>Rich perjures himself and the two share a last interaction over his new seal of office - Rich must face what he has done by succumbing to his lesser impulses.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the end, Rich&rsquo;s fate to &ldquo;die in his bed&rdquo; only serves to tell us the most important lesson: <strong>we all must die but our conduct before then is what truly matters</strong>.
