<h2>Note - Private Prison Incentives</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2022-02-09</p>
	<p><p>Adjusting private prison contracts may better align their incentives with what the public expects from them as a service.</p>
<p>Prison is intended to either <em>temporarily punish and rehabilitate</em> or <em>permanently remove</em> offenders from society.  The more cases that can be shifted to the former, the better.</p>
<p>And to do that, contracts could be based around the post-release actions of the formerly incarcerated. For example, repeat offenses, recidivism, and other lapses would <strong>negatively financially impact</strong> the prison that should be primarily focused on rehabilitation.</p>
<p>This shifts the focus of the system on improving the post-incarceration outcomes of their former inmates - similar to how ISAs have begun changing incentives in education.</p>
