<h2>Note - Citizen&#39;s Dividend vs UBI</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2020-10-08</p>
	<p><p>The difference in the concepts of a <em>citizen&rsquo;s dividend</em> and <em>universal basic income</em> (&ldquo;UBI&rdquo;) are laid out in the terms &ldquo;dividend&rdquo; and &ldquo;income.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These features are present in fiscal policy options.</p>
<p>A citizen&rsquo;s dividend in a Georgist model [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism#Revenue_uses" title="Georgism revenue uses - Wikipedia">1</a>] would derive funding from tax revenue, ideally a land value tax, minus government spending distributed on a per capita basis to all citizens.</p>
<p>A universal basic income, while fixed in theory, would likely be adjusted as legislators accommodate varying economic and political climates, which introduces the risk of amounts and recipients being arbitrarily set.</p>
<p>Relying on the non-negotiable but non-guaranteed value determined by the dividend&rsquo;s model reduces mismanagement and pressure to play to political winds.</p>
