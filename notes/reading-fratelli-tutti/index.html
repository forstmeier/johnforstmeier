<h2>Reading: Fratelli Tutti</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2020-12-17</p>
	<p><p>This is a breakdown of the encyclical <em>Fratelli Tutti</em> [<a href="http://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20201003_enciclica-fratelli-tutti.html" title="Fratelli Tutti">1</a>] written by Pope Francis.</p>
<p>The encyclical covers a wide range of topics and displays a generally more political tone while attempting to balance diverging viewpoints. Sometimes this leads to over-simplification or self-contradiction.</p>
<p>This note primarily discusses socio-economic subjects and reference numbers are provided for the appropriate sections of the encyclical.</p>

</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Culture</td>
<td>Exporting or copying cultural models reduces national identity (#51) and different cultures are not enemies (#147).</td>
<td>This ignores that some cultures are objectively better at protecting human rights (e.g. abolishing slavery).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Immigration</td>
<td>Improve origin nations to reduce unnecessary migration and avoid building welfare programs for migrants (#129) but establish comprehensive programs for necessary migration situations (#130).</td>
<td>Somewhat contradictory program scope points; providing local-level assistance and exporting state-level national improvements is likely a better and more targeted approach.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Localism</td>
<td>Globalism erodes national identity (#12), focus scope from local to global (#78), avoid universal, central planning (#100), balance nationalism and humanitarianism (#149), local organizations are more knowledgeable in local situations than global organizations are (#175).</td>
<td>Local problem solving better accounts for risk and resource assessments and avoids &ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; solutions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Economics</td>
<td>Reducing labor cost in production can produce negative consequences (#20), consumerism is destructive (#36), opportunities should include assistance to vulnerable individuals (#108), economics must not supersede human rights (#122), markets cannot solve all problems (#168).</td>
<td>Correctly states that economics must be human-centric and markets cannot solve all problems; however there are over-simplifications since reduced product costs make resources more available (e.g. cheaper food) and advance better technology (e.g. from coal to nuclear energy).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Poverty</td>
<td>Wealth has increased along with inequality and new forms of poverty (#21).</td>
<td>This point ignores that absolute poverty has drastically declined in recent decades. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_poverty#:~:text=The%20percentage%20of%20the%20global,and%201.2%20billion%20in%202008" title="Extreme poverty - Wikipedia">2</a>]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Individualism</td>
<td>Waiting for government-provided opportunities is irresponsible (#77), community relationships enrich self-definition (#89), equality does not induce fraternity (#103), individual differences build cultures (#218).</td>
<td>Unique individuals with charitable hearts working collaboratively build the strongest social fabrics; similar strength cannot be produced by legislative dictates.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Charity</td>
<td>Charity cannot be issued through one solution and must be through individual action (#165), moral formation drives individual charity (#167), and legislation can establish charity (#186).</td>
<td>The first two points conflict with the last which favors top-down solutions rather than individually-driven charitable interaction.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Borders</td>
<td>Borders cannot exclude resource access (#121 and #124), prosperous nations should support needy nations (#125).</td>
<td>Disolving borders reduces local self-determination by removing a citizen&rsquo;s right to their produced resources but arbitrary migration restrictions are also unproductive. A more &ldquo;natural&rdquo; border could be established via a citizen&rsquo;s dividend. [<a href="https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/economic-mesas-1-0/" title="Economic Mesas - Forstmeier">3</a>].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Work</td>
<td>Economic goal of no stragglers (#110), using talents in work is noble (#123), and dignity is found in work (#162).</td>
<td>Somewhat utopian in vision and will likely never be realized but points regarding self-sufficiency and &ldquo;noble work&rdquo; are practically achievable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nuclear Weapons</td>
<td>Peace and trust cannot be established through threat of violence (#262).</td>
<td>While trust may not be built, peace certainly can - nuclear proliferation has coincided with decreased intensity of violent conflicts. [<a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/uploads/Rauchhaus_Evaluating_the_Nuclear_Peace.pdf" title="Evaluating the Nuclear Peace Hypothesis: A Quantitative Approach - Rauchhaus">4</a>].</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Indigenous Peopls</td>
<td>Natives are less violent and more egalitarian (#220).</td>
<td>This conflicts with history; in the Americas tribal and imperial warfare was common as were their prehistoric contributions to early megafaunal exinctions. [<a href="https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/noble-savage-1-0/" title="Noble Savage - Forstmeier">5</a>]</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Public Order</td>
<td>Law enforcment is required in charitable societies (#164).</td>
<td>Safety and community organization cannot exist without a shared, enforced legal framework.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Private Property</td>
<td>All humans are shared stewards of world natural resources (#120).</td>
<td>This is in-line with Georgism [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgism" title="Georgism - Wikipedia">6</a>] without denying the right to personally produced products.</td>
