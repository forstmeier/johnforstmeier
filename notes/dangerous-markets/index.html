<h2>Note - Dangerous Markets</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2021-03-26</p>
	<p><blockquote>
<p>Financial markets should be easy to enter but difficult to actively participate in.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Encouraging reduced barriers to entry and limitations on participation improve price discovery through the removal of arbitrary restrictions. However, a <em>big</em> caveat should be made to retail investors so that they&rsquo;re aware that they&rsquo;re very likely outgunned by the resources available to institutional investors.</p>
<p>Markets should be much closer to an &ldquo;anything goes&rdquo; model while making transaction and holdings data public. It could be argued that rules should be seriously relaxed in a world where information is broadly available and reputational damage can be fatal - <em>the <strong>reputation market</strong> would self-regulate bad actors</em>.</p>
