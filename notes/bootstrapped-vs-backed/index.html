<h2>Note - Bootstrapped vs Backed</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2022-03-01</p>
	<p><p>Startups can generally finance via <em>bootstrapping</em> or venture capital <em>backing</em> or some combination of the two (ignoring straight debt financing as it&rsquo;s atypical in this scenario).</p>
<p>Going forward, pure software and SaaS companies are likely to start to focus on the former while hard-tech startups with a physical component will likely dominate the later.</p>
<p>The former has increasingly lower barriers for entry (hosting, tooling, etc.) - this means it&rsquo;s a more highly competitive field with lower expected upside potential for each startup. Given tools like Stripe [<a href="https://stripe.com/" title="Stripe - landing page">1</a>] or Pipe [<a href="https://pipe.com/" title="Pipe - landing page">2</a>], bootstrapping is highly viable for software-based startups.</p>
<p>Hard-tech has significant upfront costs, requiring &ldquo;jump starts&rdquo; from capital infusion investments but <em>also maintain</em> substantial upside potential - there are still <strong>moonshots</strong> in the space. This makes them attractive to outside investment.</p>
<p>Basically, I expect investor money to begin to flow towards the latter while the former focuses on building sustainable businesses from day one.</p>
