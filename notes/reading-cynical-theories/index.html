<h2>Note - Reading: Cynical Theories</h2>
<div>

	<p><p>This is a brief summary of takeaways from reading <em>Cynical Theories</em> [<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Cynical-Theories/dp/1800750048/ref=pd_lpo_14_t_0/140-8974515-7649455?_encoding=UTF8&amp;pd_rd_i=1800750048&amp;pd_rd_r=a5b2f4f1-033d-4fdd-848d-d62001eeaeb1&amp;pd_rd_w=J0LQj&amp;pd_rd_wg=cyDT9&amp;pf_rd_p=7b36d496-f366-4631-94d3-61b87b52511b&amp;pf_rd_r=WWE3GV22QXV1VXKWFTME&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=WWE3GV22QXV1VXKWFTME" title="Grievance Studies - Lindsay and Pluckrose">1</a>] by James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose of &ldquo;grievance studies affair&rdquo; [<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVk9a5Jcd1k&amp;t=104s" title="Academics expose corruption in Grievance Studies - YouTube">2</a>] infamy.</p>
<p>Overall, the book does an excellent job outlining the history of the overarching worldview termed &ldquo;critical theory&rdquo; as well as presenting a number of succinct counter arguments against it.</p>
<p>The most interesting topics covered are the breakdowns of the individual fields within the broader philosophy.</p>
<p>Tracing specific ancestries and outlining each field&rsquo;s current form and emphasis within the umbrella is highly valuable; it highlights both specific facets that the laity may more successfully understand and grapple with as well as potentially destructive tensions between the fields making up &ldquo;critical theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the final chapter a valuable distinction is presented:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Liberalism sees knowledge as something we can learn about reality, more or less objectively; [critical] Theory sees knowledges as completely created by humans -  stories we tell ourselves, largely in the unwitting service of maintaining our own social standing, privelege, and power.</p>
