<h2>Retail HFT</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2021-07-22</p>
	<p><p>High-frequency trading (&ldquo;HFT&rdquo;) [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading" title="High-frequency trading - Wikipedia">1</a>] is often portrayed negatively and as &ldquo;taking advantage&rdquo; of retail investors through blindingly fast trading strategies.</p>
<p>In reality, HFT firms are just 1) employing research and technology effectively and 2) taking on high amounts of investment risk. Essentially, they are shouldering the <em>very high</em> upfront cost of these tools which are an absolute prerequisite to even <em>trying</em> to reap the rewards of this strategy.</p>
<p>Instead of taking a stance against HFT, participation in these funds <strong>should be made directly available to more retail investors</strong> so long as they&rsquo;re aware of the risk. Reducing regulation around these investments would allow retail investors to skip shouldering the upfront cost and participate in and benefit from algorithmic trading.</p>
