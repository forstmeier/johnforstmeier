<h2>Note - Splitting Education</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2020-09-30</p>
	<p><p>Currently, there is a conflation between higher education and vocational training. Typical, four-year degrees are providing both a general education and serving as credentialing frequently required in the workforce. Separating these aspects could provide more tailored services to students based on interest and need.</p>
<p><strong>Educational</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;traditional&rdquo; four-year college environment</li>
<li>providing broad teachings and exposure to abstract concepts</li>
<li>examples: history, higher-order math, music, computer theory, etc.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; more theoretical, less appied</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Vocational</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;vocational&rdquo; work preparation environment</li>
<li>providing specific training and concepts useful in the workplace</li>
<li>examples: accounting, architecture, heavy machinery, coding, etc.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&gt; more applied, less theoretical</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With these options offered separately, maybe each as a maximum two-year option, students could mix-and-match based on their own needs. Those who want to work emphasize the vocational while those with the time and interest can dive into the educational.</p>
