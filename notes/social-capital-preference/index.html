<h2>Note - Social Capital Preference</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2021-01-15</p>
	<p><p>Some companies rely heavily on social capital as part of their continued financial success. To varying degrees, this makes them dependent on current social trends.</p>
<p>However, even companies that are <em>not</em> overly impacted by social perception (e.g. ones with strong customer stickiness) seem to seek it out. In doing so they appear to voluntarily relinquish an advantageous position.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why take on an unnecessary dependency?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe there is or always has been a strong need to &ldquo;belong&rdquo; even in profit-driven enterprises. This seems like a mistake.</p>
