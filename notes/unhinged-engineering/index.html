<h2>Note - Unhinged Engineering</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2022-11-04</p>
	<p><p>This is a loose collection of aggressive development process ideas. Some I have implemented and others I haven&rsquo;t although I will as soon as the opportunity arises.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Automated testing</strong>: tests are run automatically on each new <code>feature</code> branch and must meet coverage and quality requirements - these should be treated as &ldquo;baseline&rdquo; regression and constantly updated by both engineering and QA teams.</li>
<li><strong>Push-based process</strong>: between <code>git branch feature</code> and <code>git merge feature</code> no step should be manual - running tests, checking coverage, enforcing formatting, moving stories, alerting testers, and everything else should be automated.</li>
<li><strong>Extreme custodianship</strong>: no change is &ldquo;handed off&rdquo; to the next team (e.g. QA) - every proposed change is closely followed by the requesting developer through each step of the process which should ideally be short.</li>
<li><strong>No documentation</strong>: everything must be derived from code living in Git - self-documenting code through naming conventions, method annotations, or AI-generated interpretations must be based off of code which is the single source of truth.</li>
<li><strong>QA collaboration</strong>: developers join QA teams in manually reviewing <code>feature</code> branches - this should a) make testing requirements explicit and b) allow developers to immediately understand issues as they are discovered turning a bottleneck into a value-add.</li>
<li><strong>Dual branches</strong>: only <code>master</code> and <code>feature</code> branches exist in the development process - <code>feature</code> branches are created on-demand for each pull request with <code>master</code> as the source of truth protected by merge requirements and is constantly deployed to production from <code>HEAD</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Single commit deploys</strong>: a single, squashed, logical piece of work attached to a story under the responsibility of a sole developer - this isolates blast radius and decreases complexity in understanding errors as they arise from automatic deploys from merges into <code>master</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Single severity bugs</strong>: every bug is a <em>top</em> severity and <em>everything</em> stops until a fix has been introduced for it - this removes questions around priority or potentially losing it in a backlog.</li>
<li><strong>Roll forward fixes</strong>: bug in production are fixed via pull request incrementing the release number - rollback strategies are admitting you were wrong while rollforward strategies are declaring you just weren&rsquo;t right yet.</li>
<li><strong>Single file deploys</strong>: individual pull requests contain a single changed production file - this excludes test files and mandates small, incremental deployments.</li>
<li><strong>Test in production</strong>: developers manually testing new features in the production environment - this would come <em>after</em> automated tests on feature branches but is still critical because they&rsquo;re never <em>quite</em> the real thing.</li>
</ol>
<p>For manual testing, QA is a separate person/team but I&rsquo;m recommending the developer observe in real time as they review since they&rsquo;re &ldquo;shuttling&rdquo; the change into production. QA should also basically be adding in automated tests for their manual evaluations so yes, I&rsquo;d have them cycle through the development team.</p>
<p>On #6, yes, I&rsquo;d say squash merge into single commits so single commits going out would be the enforcement measure. And deploys to production occur immediately on merge to master which would be blocked on tests passing with additional pushes to that branch triggering test reruns.</p>
<p>This is a non-exhaustive listing but what is here is to encourage <em>speed</em> and <em>dynamism</em> throughout the development cycle.</p>
