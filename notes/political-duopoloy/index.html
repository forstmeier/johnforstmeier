<h2>Note - Political Duopoloy</h2>
<div>
	<p>> 2020-09-23</p>
	<p><p>Established political duopolies hold their members on platforms that can devolve into what can be summarized as &ldquo;anti-opposing party.&rdquo; Time is spent condemning the opposition&rsquo;s stances without defending, or sometimes even <em>presenting</em>, alternatives. While there may be philosophic stratification within the dual parties, these differences are subordinate to the party positions.</p>
<p>Splitting these duopolies into <strong>multiple mini-parties</strong> encourages more active discourse and requires proactive engagement among colleagues when presenting and defending positions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flexible, ad hoc coalition formation would be the result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This would switch the structure from implicit alignment within a larger party to explicit alliance between smaller parties. Ideally, this would also result in a better representation of constituent demographics and preferences.</p>
