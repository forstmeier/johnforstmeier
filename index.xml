      <title>FAFO Method</title>

      <description>An approach I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about is something I&amp;rsquo;m dubbing the &amp;ldquo;FAFO Method&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;fuck around, find out&amp;rdquo;.
Basically, this boils down to:
 Learn the minimum about an idea to be dangerous Quickly iterate and implement the idea  It&amp;rsquo;s not quite a &amp;ldquo;see what sticks&amp;rdquo; method because you still want to evaluate and prioritize how you spend your time prior to spending it. And then on top of that, you want to minimize the time actually spent doing the thing.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapped vs Backed</title>
      <link>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/bootstrapped-vs-backed/</link>

      <description>Startups can generally finance via bootstrapping or venture capital backing or some combination of the two (ignoring straight debt financing as it&amp;rsquo;s atypical in this scenario).
Going forward, pure software and SaaS companies are likely to start to focus on the former while hard-tech startups with a physical component will likely dominate the later.
The former has increasingly lower barriers for entry (hosting, tooling, etc.) - this means it&amp;rsquo;s a more highly competitive field with lower expected upside potential for each startup.</description>

      <title>Private Prison Incentives</title>

      <description>Adjusting private prison contracts may better align their incentives with what the public expects from them as a service.
Prison is intended to either temporarily punish and rehabilitate or permanently remove offenders from society. The more cases that can be shifted to the former, the better.
And to do that, contracts could be based around the post-release actions of the formerly incarcerated. For example, repeat offenses, recidivism, and other lapses would negatively financially impact the prison that should be primarily focused on rehabilitation.</description>

      <description>If we assume that non-human primates are experiencing evolutionary growth we may eventually face similar questions to those Lewis raises in Religion and Rocketry [1].
 For example, can the primates have evolved to the point they have received the divine spark of an immortal soul endowed with reason? If so, are they fallen, pre-fallen, post-fallen, or some other state we are not aware of? And what is our responsibility towards our newly-elevated evolutionary cousins?</description>

      <description>If you can&amp;rsquo;t do a thing, build tools for those who can.
 By this I mean that if you&amp;rsquo;re struggling to find inspiration or are interested in a field without an immediate affinity or ability you can still be productive.
You can participate indirectly by building tools for others in that field in order to help them scale their impact.</description>

      <title>Reputation Over Regulation</title>

      <description>Regulations on business interactions between entities can be arbitrary and typically come from a highly centralized source. Market participants must either lobby for changes (which ends up being dominated by larger financial players) or submit to regulation (which all ultimately have to anyway).
Finding ways to prioritize reputation markets, wherever feasible, may be a better alternative. Members of the given market would build a reputation through participation and staking value to have &amp;ldquo;skin in the game&amp;rdquo; and increase the cost to potential manipulators [1].</description>

      <description>No single city needs to supplant the San Francisco Bay Area as a high-technology center in order for that area to lose its dominant position. An unofficial confederation of other locations, ranging from urban to rural, could each sap resources from the centralized Bay Area talent.
 A slow bleed from many cuts.
 No single other location needs to rise in order to overthrow mantle. This is exemplified by the chart below; while there has been an increase as a result of the COVID-19 events, there was a pre-existing upward trend that appears to be continuing following the spike.</description>

      <title>Better Bootcamp</title>

      <description>Coding bootcamps seem to focus heavily on the coding aspect of development work. While teaching coding is important, I think bootcamps could differentiate themselves significantly by focusing on developing team-based skills and experience.
For example they could:
 provide students with guidance on how to receive and conduct pull request reviews go over designing and maintaining robust CI/CD pipelines instill best-practices for writing unit and integration tests participate in tasking stories and organizing development sprints  And this could potentially be done within the scope of a pre-existing open source project.</description>

      <description>Here are some more loose ideas on simple ways to potentially improve the U.S. political system.
Ideas
 Quantifiable legislative goals: during campaigns, politicians should pledge, or maybe even be required, to set out a handful of specific policy goals with quantifiable outcomes (and preset measurement criteria). If these goals were met, assuming a successful election, they could run again after their term expires.   Goal: move elections towards data-driven performers.</description>

      <title>Minimum Value Delivery</title>

      <guid>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/minimum-value-delivery/</guid>
      <description>Something that I have to keep reminding myself is that products aren&amp;rsquo;t just products, they&amp;rsquo;re a value delivery system. Products will only be adopted when value is received by using them. This means that the initial build of the product should contain the absolute minimum resources required to begin delivering that value.
Improvements can be rolled out in later iterations, even significant breaking changes [1], so long as value delivery can be immediately proven.</description>

      <description>There are several interesting takeaways from Victor Davis Hanson&amp;rsquo;s The Second World Wars [1]. The whole work is presented from a numerical viewpoint and basically offers &amp;ldquo;accountant&amp;rsquo;s lessons&amp;rdquo; from the war. Here are some that stood out to me.
 Emphasize support resources
  Massive production of basic support vehicles and robust supply lines were a constant focus for the Allies throughout the war &amp;ldquo;Boring&amp;rdquo; things like unarmed and unarmored trucks were essential in ensuring sustainable campaigning   Produce fewer similar models</description>

      <description>High-frequency trading (&amp;ldquo;HFT&amp;rdquo;) [1] is often portrayed negatively and as &amp;ldquo;taking advantage&amp;rdquo; of retail investors through blindingly fast trading strategies.
In reality, HFT firms are just 1) employing research and technology effectively and 2) taking on high amounts of investment risk. Essentially, they are shouldering the very high upfront cost of these tools which are an absolute prerequisite to even trying to reap the rewards of this strategy.
Instead of taking a stance against HFT, participation in these funds should be made directly available to more retail investors so long as they&amp;rsquo;re aware of the risk.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s somewhat of an obvious statement, but software is best utilized when directly improving the physical world. That&amp;rsquo;s something that I think can be lost from the software developer and venture capital perspective. Keeping the &amp;ldquo;world of atoms&amp;rdquo; at the forefront can help truly realize the value of software by positioning it accordingly.</description>

      <guid>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/reading-the-coddling-of-the-american-mind/</guid>
      <description>This is a brief summary of The Coddling of the American Mind [1] by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt.
In short, it is a well developed, explained, and supported book that is heavily data-driven. Overall, the book is critical of the &amp;ldquo;safetyism&amp;rdquo; which is increasingly present in society and encourages building more resillient members of the broader community.
The authors highlight specific issues in how the younger generations (at the time of its writing) are being raised and present targeted solutions that parents may act upon.</description>

      <description>This post reflects a general personal sense - I&amp;rsquo;ve looked for no data to back up the position. It&amp;rsquo;s purely an observation and prediction based on gut. That statement is:
 The current political and social climate is turning my generation towards tradition.
 Being inundated with polarization while simultaneously being drawn into diametrically opposed systems of hyper-individualism and hyper-collectivism has been socially destructive. Individualism destroys meaning while collectivism destroys agency.</description>

      <description>MVPs (&amp;ldquo;minimum viable products&amp;rdquo;) shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be built in a way to handle a wide range of future use cases.
For example, an MVP for an API-based service shouldn&amp;rsquo;t focus on accommodating future expansions in its first iteration. Constructing a simple, albeit rigid, pattern addressing the immediate need is the goal. If no one is using the API, focusing on delivering something that can be used to gather feedback is more important than planning for every eventuality.</description>

      <description>Financial markets should be easy to enter but difficult to actively participate in.
 Encouraging reduced barriers to entry and limitations on participation improve price discovery through the removal of arbitrary restrictions. However, a big caveat should be made to retail investors so that they&amp;rsquo;re aware that they&amp;rsquo;re very likely outgunned by the resources available to institutional investors.
Markets should be much closer to an &amp;ldquo;anything goes&amp;rdquo; model while making transaction and holdings data public.</description>

      <description>The term &amp;ldquo;progressive&amp;rdquo; has been conflated with the word &amp;ldquo;expansive&amp;rdquo; with regards to legislative initiatives. In some ways, this is similar to the theme in Peter Thiel&amp;rsquo;s [1] book Zero to One [2].
 moving 0 -&amp;gt; 1 creates an entirely new solution moving 1 -&amp;gt; N scales an existing solution  The latter is dominant while being billed as the former in legislation. Currently, this is particularly true in two areas: minimum wage and college education.</description>

      <description>Using numbers when defining a task establishes a specific and measureable outcome.

      <description>The short essay &amp;ldquo;Religion and Rocketry&amp;rdquo; from C.S. Lewis&amp;rsquo; [1] collection The World&amp;rsquo;s Last Night [2] addresses the existence of extraterrestrial life.
What&amp;rsquo;s interesting about this piece is that it takes their existence for granted and digs into the theological and ethical implications their existence entails. Lewis poses a series of questions regarding their spiritual nature - two in particular ask whether the aliens are fallen, as we are, and what, if any, mechanism exists for their redemption.</description>

      <description>Anecdotally to the observer, it seems that national adversity produces heroes while personal adversity produces victims.
 Why is there a perceived difference and why can&amp;rsquo;t personal adversity produce public heroes?
 In national-level issues, everyone is impacted and all shoulder the burden while a few rise as leaders. For example, in World War II individuals such as Churchill [1], Murphy [2], Winters [2], and Sendler [4] are rightfully treated as heroes for their noble defense of freedom even as the conflict touched all lives.</description>

      <description>Here are a series of short notes on G.K. Chesterton&amp;rsquo;s [1] book Orthodoxy [2].
Chesterton earns the nickname the &amp;ldquo;prince of paradox&amp;rdquo;; every chapter contains multiple statements that flip the conventional perspective. Two statements in particular from the chapter &amp;ldquo;The Flag of the World&amp;rdquo; stood out.
 Rational optimism leads to stagnation; it is irrational optimism that leads to reform.

 Has the net impact of social media been positive or negative in developed nations? Has the net impact of social media been positive or negative in underdeveloped nations? If there is a difference in the answers to those questions, what causes the disparity?  These services have contributed positively and negatively to the world - identifying what distribution these contributions take would be valuable in helping to understand their proper function.</description>

      <description>A progressive approach to education is to experiment with new methods intead of focusing solely on expanding access to old methods.
These older methods, particularly the four year college in the U.S., are increasingly misaligned with student goals and fail to deliver successful outcomes. [1]
Pumping money into failing approaches is not progressive.</description>

      <description>Several aspects of the Beehive State&amp;rsquo;s socio-economic approach are discussed in an article titled &amp;ldquo;Utah’s Economic Exceptionalism&amp;rdquo; [1] by Natalie Gochnour.
While the state&amp;rsquo;s economic position was solid during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, both in terms of mitigating negative fallout and general rising economic performance, the basis for this success appears to have been in place well prior to the outbreak.
The article points to factors like low income disparity, high upward mobility, and even highly unusual feats such as under budget and early completion in major public works projects as indicators of the state&amp;rsquo;s favorable economic strategy.</description>

      <description>Some companies rely heavily on social capital as part of their continued financial success. To varying degrees, this makes them dependent on current social trends.
However, even companies that are not overly impacted by social perception (e.g. ones with strong customer stickiness) seem to seek it out. In doing so they appear to voluntarily relinquish an advantageous position.
 Why take on an unnecessary dependency?
 Maybe there is or always has been a strong need to &amp;ldquo;belong&amp;rdquo; even in profit-driven enterprises.</description>

      <description>Increased local political autonomy may reduce voting majorities to their smallest sphere of influence. This would lead to many, independent, and encapsulated majorities operating within a larger, shared population.
Several interesting points arise in this situation:
 Any tyrannical majority is confined to a small operating area In worst cases even tyrannical majorities are likely generally aligned with local interests Constituents may easily move from tyrannical majorities to elsewhere within the larger population  </description>

      <description>This piece is on Bad Blood [1] by John Carreyrou [2].
I was familiar with the story of Elizabeth Holmes [3] and her company Theranos [4] but the book provided greater insight into how she interacted with people regarding her work.
It is unclear whether her extreme focus on &amp;ldquo;her mission&amp;rdquo; was a manipulative effort or actual self-denial; her actions could support both positions.
There are many instances of Holmes legally pursuing whistleblowers and publicly attacking external detractors - essentially anyone threatening the positive perception of Theranos.</description>

      <description>As of the time of this writing, the average dropout rate for U.S. college freshmen is approximately 30%. Traditional four-year schools appear to be un/intentionally positioning for this to maximize value extraction from attending students.
Anecdotal observations point to freshman and sophomore classes having significantly higher student-teacher ratios than junior and senior classes, on average.
Several education spaces at the Penn State University Park campus have massive seating capacity and are often used by lower-year classes.</description>

      <description>Continuously testing entire code repositories increases the ability to introduce rapid changes. Being able to do this in early stages, such as the MVP, is highly valuable.
Simple approaches, like adding a unit_tests script to the repo containing just a go test ./... -coverage command [1][2] achieve this. Even though it would initially be triggered manually, doing so would provide value to the developer even before a complete CI/CD pipeline could be established.</description>

      <description>This is a breakdown of the encyclical Fratelli Tutti [1] written by Pope Francis.
The encyclical covers a wide range of topics and displays a generally more political tone while attempting to balance diverging viewpoints. Sometimes this leads to over-simplification or self-contradiction.
This note primarily discusses socio-economic subjects and reference numbers are provided for the appropriate sections of the encyclical.

      <description>Actions taken to accomplish good works should be done without seeking attention.
 Sometimes attention is unavoidable but it should be reduced to the minimal amount needed to get the work done or to what will maximize the impact of the act.
Everything else above this minimized amount is performative and serves no other purpose than self-aggrandizement.</description>

      <description>Sometimes prior stages of human development are presented as a model to emulate with claims the early homo genuses better coexisted with their natural environment.
Contrary evidence [1] indicates early humans directly contributed to megafaunal extinction events across the globe; the correlative findings show mass extinctions were immediately preceeded by the arrival of migrating humans. Other factors may have contributed but these were not as significant as the presence of human hunters.</description>

      <description>This is a brief summary of takeaways from reading Cynical Theories [1] by James Lindsay and Helen Pluckrose of &amp;ldquo;grievance studies affair&amp;rdquo; [2] infamy.
Overall, the book does an excellent job outlining the history of the overarching worldview termed &amp;ldquo;critical theory&amp;rdquo; as well as presenting a number of succinct counter arguments against it.
The most interesting topics covered are the breakdowns of the individual fields within the broader philosophy.
Tracing specific ancestries and outlining each field&amp;rsquo;s current form and emphasis within the umbrella is highly valuable; it highlights both specific facets that the laity may more successfully understand and grapple with as well as potentially destructive tensions between the fields making up &amp;ldquo;critical theory.</description>

      <description>An alternative news consumption paradigm could be one where individuals build themselves ad-hoc collections to establish a &amp;ldquo;microservice architecture&amp;rdquo; of preferred sources. Ideally, these sources would be smaller groups or independent journalists potentially providing highly specialized coverage and reporting - some sources might even exist only as long as the story they cover. All news producers would be treated as modular and replaceable.
This fragmentation would force consumers to actively build their own networks while also reducing narrative centralization from large producers.</description>

      <description>Impressionism [1] as a painting style has a strong personal, albeit uninformed, appeal.
The style prefers to see everything in a given scope without focusing on specific details. Produced images are more of a summary or a simplification of the subject which significantly reduces cognitive overhead in consuming these pieces.
A favorite is The Battle of the Kearsarge and the Alabama [2] by Édouard Manet, pictured below.
Personal highlights:

      <description>A non-guaranteed citizen&amp;rsquo;s dividend introduces fiscal competition between political parties that are members of the dividend issuing government.
For common equity dividends the amount per share is determined by profit surplus roughly calculated as revenue minus cost. Similarly, a citizen&amp;rsquo;s dividend is determined by government revenue minus government cost. Given government revenue is often primarily driven by taxation, the least impactful way to increase distributions to constituents is to reduce government costs.</description>

      <description>Established political duopolies hold their members on platforms that can devolve into what can be summarized as &amp;ldquo;anti-opposing party.&amp;rdquo; Time is spent condemning the opposition&amp;rsquo;s stances without defending, or sometimes even presenting, alternatives. While there may be philosophic stratification within the dual parties, these differences are subordinate to the party positions.
Splitting these duopolies into multiple mini-parties encourages more active discourse and requires proactive engagement among colleagues when presenting and defending positions.</description>

      <description>The land value tax (&amp;ldquo;LVT&amp;rdquo;) at the center of Georgism directly encourages efficient land usage in energy production. Given that this core principal assesses taxes as a percentage of the value of the land held, it drives producers to establish the smallest physical footprint possible.
If it were introduced, there would be an immediate impact to all existing energy producers:
 &amp;ldquo;Traditional&amp;rdquo; fuels (e.g. oil, LNG, coal): large land, and potentially offshore, resources would be adjusted to find the optimal boundary of exerting exclusive rights to the resources and minimizing the taxable land held; additionally the valuable resources held in the land would increase the land value and taxes owed.</description>

      <description>Some characteristics of pharmaceuticals make them comparable to software. Basically software and pharmaceuticals have:
 high development costs low distribution costs  For example, both require a large, upfront resource investment in research and composition. After initial R&amp;amp;D expenses, both are relatively easily manufactured and distributed at scale.
Knowing this, pharmaceuticals may be well placed to leverage wide-reaching treatments while reducing healthcare costs. Additionally, with precision medicine [1], highly-focused solutions can be developed or even compounded on-demand for individual use to increase effectiveness.</description>

      <description>One of the most important skills a small team can collectively have is the ability to identify what they don&amp;rsquo;t need to build for a minimum viable product (&amp;ldquo;MVP&amp;rdquo;).
Smaller teams inherently have fewer human resources available to build things and must prioritize. An open two-way dialogue between the team and the customer helps identify the core value the product provides the customers. With this the team can provide that initial core value in their MVP even if it&amp;rsquo;s held together with rubber bands and bubble gum.</description>

A certain amount of structure is definitely necessary to enable human socio-economic interactions. But evaluations of the structure should be constantly made:

      <description>A citizen&amp;rsquo;s dividend would create an &amp;ldquo;economic mesa&amp;rdquo; and establish a natural and humane border.
Following the Georgist [1] model, a citizen&amp;rsquo;s dividend would have the side effect of providing an additional method for defining and enforcing sovereign territory. Legal citizens would receive the non-guaranteed dividend, pro rata, which would generally shift prices higher in the region they spend it - predominantly where they live. A resource disparity would arise between the citizens and the citizens of neighboring countries.</description>

      <description>Something to consider:
 Equity creates equity in the employees from the point of view of the company.
  Equity: relatively non-liquid asset conveying financial value from dividends and non-financial value from voting rights Salary: highly liquid asset conveying financial value on receipt and provides no non-financial value  The former establishes a direct and more-or-less permanent investment in the company by the employee while the latter is available to the employee only through the life of the employment contract.</description>

      <description>While I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with most philosophic and religious traditions, I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine a world that is better where Great Meteoron, Potala Palace, Shaolin Temple, Simonopetra, Blagaj Tekke, Sera Monastery, Tungnath, and many others, are silent. I really believe these monuments, and the faiths that they symbolize, to be important to our shared social fabric and our connection to our past.
The beauty and diversity of antique philosophy should be fought for and maintained.</description>

      <title>Opportunities For Good</title>

      <description>Something that strikes me:
 Small opportunities to be good seem so difficult to take advantage of while the truly great require no deliberation.
 I wonder if this has to do with smaller opportunities so often coming into conflict with prevailing social norms while the options that accompany truly great opportunities are universally held to be true. Now this isn&amp;rsquo;t to say the small are lesser but that accomplishing them requires a different kind of courage.</description>

      <description>Boring problems often have fascinating solutions.
 This may be more or less true, and is likely dependent on personal experience, but I’ve found that boring problems have typically been left un-explored for the very reason that they’re boring. This makes it all new territory for someone venturing into it. Whatever they make to solve the problem will be entirely new.</description>

Active listening is a real thing; when I realize someone is really listening, the conversation has real meaning. I strive to provide the same attention.</description>

      <description>Collaboration, communication, community.
 These are three core principles I look for in projects I associate myself with. Open/active discussions about the roadmap with no one individual deciding things, clearly and consistently adhering to a roadmap, and including all stakeholders in formalizing the roadmap.</description>

      <guid>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/requirements-over-process/</guid>
      <description>Favor requirements over processes while building. When you do need a process, automate it.
By this I mean prioritize quality or production requirements rather than dictating how to build things. Creating process pipelines, or enforcing strict architectures before they can be evaluated, likely stifles creativity - anything needing a process should be automated and never thought about.
Basically: let people be creative and then when they&amp;rsquo;ve built some cool things, formalize and automate the things that prevent them from being creative.</description>

      <description>It really seems like a minimal resource set necessitates creative solutions and efficient design.
I’m a firm believer in this. It’s sort of like building with a limited number of LEGOs: it forces you to think creatively and with imagination while also knowing intimately the number of pieces you have left and how they can work together.
 Necessity is the mother of invention.

      <description>Variables utilized in human decision making should be based in the natural world rather than arbitrary selection.
An example of this is consent. In order for consent to be actually given, the individual has to be fully cognizant of the situation and not coerced. Being cognizant would, theoretically, require a fully developed brain - although this can’t be accurately assessed on-demand and on a case-by-case basis, the age for consent (alcohol, military service, driving, sex, etc.</description>

      <description>Work is still work - it isn&amp;rsquo;t always fun. But it sucks when it used to be.
It&amp;rsquo;s a bit whiny but feeling burnout at work, especially when the environment used to be engaging, fun, dynamic, and rewarding, really sucks.</description>

      <description>The goal of increased individual self-direction requires providing both the individual decision-making capacity and the resources to take action with.
This is a personal goal of mine to provide both of these factors for both myself in my own life and for others in theirs. Individuals should be maximally free to self-direct and be able to utilize as many resources as possible, in many cases, to engage in productive endeavors.</description>

      <description>Many innovations today focus on making life easier - why not build things that make life more challenging?
This sounds silly but I like the idea of building things that push us forward and challenge us physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, philosophically. Things like hard science and deep tech are going to really push us more than service-based innovation.</description>

      <description>Companies that unite shareholders and stakeholders invest in their employees and community. And this happens at the same time.
Introducing perpetually issued and held &amp;ldquo;sweat equity&amp;rdquo; for employees helps to build bonds with employees and alleviate reliance on the &amp;ldquo;salary drug.&amp;rdquo; Bringing these two together lets individuals keep what they build. [1]</description>

      <description>Large numbers of small producers reduces market consolidation and increases economic resiliency. Sort of an microservice economy.
While there&amp;rsquo;s nothing inherently wrong with large producers, who often provide beneficial economies of scale, smaller operations may more easily avoid turning employees into &amp;ldquo;cogs.&amp;rdquo; Also, with smaller operations, there&amp;rsquo;s less possibility of drastic market centralization and consolidation of risk. No one entity dictates the activities of the market.</description>

      <description>An important aspect of craftsmanship is earning the pride you take in your work.
The &amp;ldquo;niche&amp;rdquo; production approach where output is owned by the individuals who produce it, as encouraged by distributism, encourages thoughtful satisfaction in one&amp;rsquo;s accomplishment.</description>

      <guid>https://johnforstmeier.com/notes/distributism-maker-ownership/</guid>
      <description>The theory of distributism [1] encourages maker ownership of the means and output of production while maintaining a free market. Together, this makes for a system designed around individual self-direction and establishes human dignity at the center of the philosophy.
A move towards distributism is a move towards a true system of social justice.</description>

      <description>Unscripted interactions are the truest demonstration of a subject matter knowledge and interest.
I&amp;rsquo;ve always preferred unscripted and unprompted discussions. I think the reason for this is because I think it shows a more genuine side of the subject.
For example, I prefer the live/unscripted entertainment bits provided by Rooster Teeth and Funhaus over the more choreographed pieces. Similarly, I think I received more thoughtful and groundbreaking insight from C.S. Lewis&amp;rsquo;s notes and letter than I have from most of his &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; works.</description>

      <description>Maximizing productive output while maintaining individual rights and dignity is the primary concern in an increasingly automated workforce system. Open source caters to this scenario and provides hyper-productive individuals with a series of resources to leverage their output and effectively provide for consumers.
Benefits
 Common knowledge pool: shared and open intellectual property which reduces &amp;ldquo;reinvention&amp;rdquo; by participants creating proprietary alternatives Non-overlapping markets: entities focus on &amp;ldquo;peripheral&amp;rdquo; markets surrounding shared core resources which encourages focus on competitive advantages Lower entry barriers: new participants can enter market rapidly as core intellectual property is openly available for use Value creation prioritization: more value is created from open resources than is captured by each individual producer Balances market forces: monopolization and perfect competition are avoided through public core resources and competitive advantage focuses Supply chain cooperation: &amp;ldquo;niche&amp;rdquo; edge producers collaborating between individual horizontal and vertical segments Adaptive technologies: common core resources with multiple contributors provides rapid updates for changing environments/requirements  Consumers benefit in this scenario of a hyper-productive minority operating in a highly automated workforce through more rapid innovation and product development.</description>

      <description>Open source software projects are a collaborative effort. Individual developers contribute to the betterment of the project and create a publicly available, shared resource.
This model opts to create, rather than directly capture, value. Additionally, competitive markets are maintained around the project since individuals are free to take it and build products or services using it.
Since all parties share core intellectual property, competition is encouraged around the &amp;ldquo;edges&amp;rdquo; and where comparative advantages apply with some participants opting to keep these facets closed source.</description>
