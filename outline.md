general information

- notes
    - farmer ownership
    - farm as a platfrom
    - field as a service
    - reduce equipment/cost overheads
    - increase saf specialization
    - inter-farm orchestration
    - usda "farm business" definition == >$350k GCFI or <$350k GCFI with farming as primary occupation

- what are GMOs (specifically)?
    - plants genetically improved
    - more resillient + higher yields
    - greater sustainability + more nutrition
- do fertilizers allow more crops per season?
    - not more crops
    - ensure high yields
    - no fertilizers significantly impact output
- how many crops are grown per season on average (in the U.S.)?
    - depends on the region
    - warmer areas allow "winter crops" to be grown
    - called "double cropping"
    - riskier in some climates
    - creates insurance burden/risk
- how many crop seasons are there in the U.S.?
    - 1-2 depending on the region
    - seasons
        - fall: crop harvest
        - winter: farm maintenance
        - spring: preparation/planting
        - summer: crop support
- what is crop rotation?
    - planting different crops different seasons
    - avoids "monocropping"
    - depletes nutrients
    - allows less reliance on fertilizer/pesticides
- what is a cover crop?
    - non-harvested crop
    - prevents soil errosion
    - encourages soil health
- can plants be engineered to grow faster?
    - nasa technics "trick" plants to bloom
    - blue/red LED lights
    - ~6x faster

saf information

- notes
    - one of the two main hypotheses
    - coordinate saf
    - improve productivity
    - production at/above $500k GCFI
    - farms can also be categorized as "small" based on GCFI
        - this likely has overlap but also increase the farm count
        - USDA seems to indicate anything below $350k GCFI
    - USDA "farm specialization" definition
        - 50% or more value
        - driven from single commodity (e.g. type of crop)

- how many SAFs are there (this might be in the original post)?
    - as of 2014 ~294k farms
    - <= 10 acres
    - ~50% all farms in US are <$10k GCFI
- what is the geographic distribution of SAFs?
    - as of 2014 made up 13% of all US farms
- what is the >$500k GCFI SAFs production breakdown?
    - ~46k $10k-$500k GCFI
    - ~3600 >$500k GCFI
- how much heavy machinery to SAFs own vs rent service out?
- are SAFs involved more in farm co-ops?
    - "production" and "market" contracts
    - former used by livestock saf specializers
    - do a single lifecycle element
    - operators making income from off-farm work
    - hired elsewhere provides income
- https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-structure-and-organization/farm-structure-and-contracting/
- https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-economy/farm-sector-income-finances/assets-debt-and-wealth/
    - lower liquidity may be bad
    - locking up resources in hard assets
    - unable to participate/diversify elsewhere
- https://www.ers.usda.gov/webdocs/publications/43847/46432_eib123.pdf?v=0
    - poultry, hogs, greenhouses largest shares of saf sales
        - things that can live indoors w/ controlled environments
        - allows intensive growing
        - year-round production
    - All farms and small acreage (SA) farms with $10,000 or more in sales in 2007, by operator age
        - farming population is aging
    - Small acreage (SA) farms by sales class in 2007
        - split between opposite ends of the graph
    - saf only need ~$10k NCFI (net cash farm income) (from 2014) to break even

faas information

- notes
    - fits into saf productivity
        - creates "twin"
        - integrates digitally
        - encourages data richness
    - more data fed into fass == better saf integration/orchestration
    - more data from individual farms == more efficient equipment deployment
    - give data == get better service (from farmer perspective)
    - get data == give better service (from provider perspective)
    - "field-driven actions"
