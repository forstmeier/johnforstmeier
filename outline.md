- what are GMOs (specifically)?
    - plants genetically improved
    - more resillient + higher yields
    - greater sustainability + more nutrition
- do fertilizers allow more crops per season?
    - not more crops
    - ensure high yields
    - no fertilizers significantly impact output
- how many crops are grown per season on average (in the U.S.)?
    - depends on the region
    - warmer areas allow "winter crops" to be grown
    - called "double cropping"
    - riskier in some climates
    - creates insurance burden/risk
- how many crop seasons are there in the U.S.?
    - 1-2 depending on the region
    - seasons
        - fall: crop harvest
        - winter: farm maintenance
        - spring: preparation/planting
        - summer: crop support
- what is crop rotation?
    - planting different crops different seasons
    - avoids "monocropping"
    - depletes nutrients
    - allows less reliance on fertilizer/pesticides
- what is a cover crop?
    - non-harvested crop
    - prevents soil errosion
    - encourages soil health
- can plants be engineered to grow faster?
    - nasa technics "trick" plants to bloom
    - blue/red LED lights
    - ~6x faster
